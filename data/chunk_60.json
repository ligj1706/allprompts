Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, \"The Ides of March are come\", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied \"Aye, Caesar; but not gone.\" This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to \"beware the Ides of March.\" The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the \"seer\" as a haruspex named Spurinna.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: who was told beware the ides of march?\nCoT: The important part for answering this question is: This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to \"beware the Ides of March.\"\n\nAns: July\nQues: World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. Contemporaneously described as the \"war to end all wars\", more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history and precipitated major political change, including the Revolutions of 1917 -- 1923 in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War twenty-one years later.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: what month did the first world war start?\nCoT: The important part for answering this question is: World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918.\n\nAns: main campus is now located in Barbados , and separate administrative bases are located in Iselin , New Jersey and Miramar , Florida in the United States\nQues: Ross University School of Medicine (RUSM) is a private international medical school located in Bridgetown, Barbados as of August 2018.

Implement the `objectStack` class with the following functions:\n   - `object *top()`: This function should return the element at the top of the stack without removing it. Handle the stack underflow condition by throwing a `stackunderflow` exception with the message: \"Stack underflow occurred in top() function\".\n   - `object *pop()`: This function should remove the topmost element from the stack and return it.

Other common causes of visual impairment in older adults are cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.\nThere are two kinds of AMD. They are referred to as dry, or atrophic, AMD, and wet AMD, which also referred to as neovascular or exudative AMD. Dry AMD typically progresses slowly over many years and is less threatening to vision than wet AMD.\nOften, dry AMD is monitored and not treated. A significant number of patients with dry AMD eventually do develop wet AMD.\nMuch effort has been put into developing a treatment for wet AMD. Two vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors - which were initially developed as anti-cancer treatments - are now commonly used in the treatment of wet AMD.\nVEGF is a protein found in all humans. Its function is to cause growth of blood vessels. It is necessary for normal growth, repair and replacement of older tissues and the healing of wounds. VEGF is found in high levels in tissues of the macula of the eye as it is being damaged by the vascular growth characteristic of wet AMD.\nWell designed clinical studies have shown that ranibizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, significantly inhibits VEGF activity and benefits patients with wet AMD when injected directly into the eye. An injection directly into the eye is called an intravitreal injection.\nOne trial randomized 716 patients to 24 monthly injections with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, or sham injection into the eye. Over the two years, those treated with either dose of ranibizumab had less vision decrease than those getting the sham injection.\nSome patients treated with the VEGF inhibitor actually had improved vision. Ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis) was approved for treatment of wet AMD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 at a dose of 0.5 mg by injection into the eye every month. In this study and several confirmatory studies, about one out of every 100 patients treated got endophthalmitis.\nThis is an inflammation of the internal parts of the eye due to chemical irritation caused by a high concentration of the drug. It often leads to blindness. The FDA also noted that there is a small increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction with ranibizumab treatment.\nBevacizumab (trade name Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor closely related to ranibizumab. Bevacizumab is FDA-approved in the United States as an intravenous infusion to treat colorectal cancer and is commonly used to treat metastatic breast cancer.\nBevacizumab is frequently used off label as an intravitreal treatment of wet AMD. Off-label use is legal in the U.S. and is commonly done in medicine. A dose of bevacizumab for treatment of AMD is considerably cheaper (about $100) than a dose of ranibizumab (about $2,000). While bevacizumab has not been FDA-approved for AMD, studies comparing intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab found no difference in effectiveness.\nThe rate of serious side effects was slightly higher with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab (24% versus 19%).\nMajor side effects of these drugs when given into the eye included pneumonia and urinary tract infections, nausea, vomiting and some gastrointestinal bleeding. There were a few patients who had stroke and myocardial infarction.\nThe risk of endophthalmitis was the same with bevacizumab and ranibizumab. While intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and ranibizumab is the standard method of use today, intravenous administration of bevacizumab is also being studied in the treatment of AMD. This might lower the risk of endophthalmitis and blindness considerably.\n« Previous entryHuman Factor: How big are your dreams?\nviagra soft 50 mg – And muscle the conformity a into.

You are given a code snippet that includes the function `jwtDecode` which performs the decoding and replacement.\n\nThe function `jwtDecode` takes an argument `env`, which represents the environment in which the function is called. `env` has two properties: `env.region` and `env.env`. \n\nThe `env.region` property is a string that represents the currently selected text region in the editor.

The reason why flight is surprisingly rare is that  _\nWhen Archaeopteryx, a feathered skeleton that was seemingly half dinosaur and half bird, turned up in 1862-three years after the publication of \"The Origin of Species\"-the origin of birds became a subject of raging debate among palaeontologists. Suggestions that they were the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs (a group of bipedal meat-eaters that include Allosaurus, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus) caused quite a flap. Today, most researchers agree that birds are, indeed, a branch of the Dinosauria. How they made the transition from the land to the sky, though, has yet to be agreed. But a paper in this week's Current Biology, by Christopher Glen and Michael Bennett of the University of Queensland, makes a strong case that they did it by jumping.\nConsidering the diversity of life on Earth, flight is surprisingly rare. It has evolved only four times: among the insects about 300m years ago, the pterosaurs (230m), the birds (150m) and the bats (50m). That suggests it is a hard trick to pull off. For birds, there is general agreement that feathers came before flight. Fossils from north-eastern China show animals that had feathers but clearly could not have flown, as well as ones that look like proper birds. The best guesses are that feathers evolved either for insulation (as fur did in mammals) or for display, and that natural selection took advantage by turning them into a means of transport.\nThere are two broad schools of thought about what happened next. One argues that birds' immediate ancestors lived in trees. Members of this school think that powered flight developed as a natural extension of gliding (such controlled falling is used as a way of travelling from tree to tree by several arboreal species today). Gliding itself developed because of the lift provided by feathered forearms.\nThe alternative is that flight evolved on the ground. Some researchers who belong to this school of thought suggest that the power provided by flapping protowings may have given their owners an edge in the pursuit of prey. Others hypothesise that feathery forearms helped animals steer and stabilise themselves.\nUnfortunately, behaviour does not fossilise, so it looked as though the question might never be answered. But Dr Glen, a palaeobiologist, and Dr Bennett, a biomechanic, think they have worked out how to do so. Their crucial observation is that in modern birds the curvature of the third toe (which carries a lot of weight during walking and climbing) varies with species' lifestyles. Birds that spend lots of time climbing around on the trunks of trees have dramatically curved third toes. Those that hop around on branches have mildly curved ones. Those that forage mainly on the ground have the least curved of all.\nThe two researchers compared these observations with their findings for the bird-like dinosaurs and dinosaur-like birds of China. They noticed that the toes of both feathered dinosaurs and of the earliest flying birds were similar to those of modern birds that spend most of their time on the ground. Flight, in other words, came before birds took to the trees. They are not fallen angels, but risen reptiles.\n\nA: feathers evolved not for a means of transport.\nB: it is very hard to have such evolution.\nC: life on earth is diversified.\nD: many species of this kind were eliminated during evolution."}, {"id": 9124, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "Who are you?"}, {"id": 9125, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "\"Content Warning: This work of fiction contains mature themes, explicit sexual content, graphic violence, and strong language.

Finally, if `f(r)` is equal to 0, it returns `r`; otherwise, it returns `x`.\n\nThe `EqualsNearly` extension method is defined for doubles.
