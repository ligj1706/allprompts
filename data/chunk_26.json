Becoming great requires the guidance, support, and wisdom of others who model outstanding leadership behavior. Christian leaders need individuals they can respect and imitate which can be hard to find in a world where being successful doesn't always mean commanding with character. David, the great king of Israel and major writer of the Psalms, is one of the greatest leaders in history. His writings offer us a window into this heart-the heart of a shepherd, a king, and most of all God's servant. In Maximum Integrity, Stan Toler and Jerry Brecheisen look at several of the psalms especially suited for the moods and needs of leaders and share insights born from the times when, during their own life journeys, they paused and allowed themselves to be changed by the words of King David. Using David's life as a model--including his leadership techniques and personal triumphs and failures--Toler and Brecheisen offer Christian principles and strategies for leaders to meditate on and live by. Maximum Integrity provides leaders with practical ways to apply the teachings of the ancient psalms to their lives today and encourages them to remember to trust God to help direct and care for them--no matter what the situation may be.\n\"Your only job is to help your players be better.\" That single idea had a huge impact on Tony Dungy when he heard it from one of his earliest mentors, and it led him to develop the successful leadership style so admired by players and coaches throughout the NFL. Now, a storied career and a Super Bowl victory later, Tony Dungy is sharing his unique leadership philosophy with you. In The Mentor Leader, Tony reveals what propelled him to the top of his profession and shows how you can apply the same approach to virtually any area of your life. In the process, you'll learn the seven keys of mentoring leadership--and why they're so effective; why mentor leadership brings out the best in people; how a mentor leader recovers from mistakes and handles team discipline; and the secret to getting people to follow you and do their best for you without intimidation tactics. As a son, a football player, and a winning coach, Tony has always learned from others on his path to success. Now you can learn to succeed for your team, family, or organization while living out your values--by becoming a mentor leader.\nIn The Missional Leader, consultants Alan Roxburgh and Fred Romanuk give church and denominational leaders, pastors, and clergy a clear model for leading the change necessary to create and foster a missional church focused outward to spread the message of the Gospel into the surrounding community. The Missional Leader emphasizes principles rather than institutional forms, shows readers how to move away from \"church as usual,\" and demonstrates what capacities, environments, and mindsets are required to lead a missional church.\nNever Blink in a Hailstorm OP!!!!\nLeadership can be an exhilarating experience. But it also has its challenges. Leaders who cast visions, explore options, and take risks are also restricted by legal, ethical, organizational, and positional boundaries. When it comes to testing these boundaries, experience is key. Author David L. McKenna is a leadership expert with over thirty years of experience in leadership roles. Building off of his administrative positions at a variety of colleges and seminaries, McKenna now introduces fourteen maxims that all leaders should read. Drawing examples from the ultimate leader, Jesus Christ, McKenna imparts practical advice like, \"Never hide behind a gas mask\" and \"Never play God.\" The advice in these short, catchy chapters will provide clarity and wisdom for pastors, church leaders, and any Christian who serves in a leadership role.\nEvery church and ministry goes through changes in leadership, and the issue is far bigger than the wave of pastors from the Baby Boomer generation who are moving toward retirement. When a pastor leaves a church, ministries are disrupted and members drift away. If the church is already struggling, it can find itself suddenly in very dire straits indeed. But the outcome doesn't have to be that way.\nWhat if when a pastor moved on, the church knew exactly what to do to find a suitable replacement because a plan and a process had been in place for some time? While there is no simple, one-size-fits-all solution to the puzzle of planning for a seamless pastoral succession, \"Next\" offers church leaders and pastors a guide to asking the right questions in order to plan for the future. Vanderbloemen, founder of a leading pastoral search firm, and Bird, an award-winning writer and researcher, share insider stories of succession successes and failures in dozens of churches, including some of the nation's most influential. Through case studies, interviews, and real-time research, the authors demystify successful pastoral succession and help readers prepare for an even brighter future for their ministries.\nNOW DISCOVER YOUR STRENGTHS OSI!\nMany traits that drive us to succeed have the potential of bringing out a dark side of leadership.

Here at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, the Electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire, or ePAQ, is used to assess pelvic floor symptoms in women. So it is a PROM that's specific to a particular clinical area rather than being generic. Here we talk to Dr. Steve Radley about its development and application. ePAQ is an electronic questionnaire system. It's web-based. It's designed for clinical use. It allows patients to self-complete a comprehensive and detailed assessment of their symptomatology and associated health-related quality of life. It evolved from questionnaires developed as research outcome measures but now has evolved into something that's very much for clinical use, for routine clinical assessment of patients. We issue vouchers, which are sent out to patients, posted or emailed to patients, to allow them to complete the questionnaire at home using the internet. And most of our patients, about 70% of patients, will now do this at home before they come to clinic. And also, post-operatively or post-intervention patients will, again, complete the questionnaire, the majority doing so at home. And the majority of surgical cases will be able to then be seen or assessed in a virtual clinic, the virtual clinic being ePAQ combined with telephone consultation. So I was aware of the value and the power of using questionnaires-- well-validated questionnaires, well-designed questionnaires-- for monitoring outcomes in research. And what I wanted to do was translate that into clinical practice and to use it routinely for all patients coming into this unit. And what we found when we tried to do that on paper was that we generated a lot of paper, and it's a bit of a waste of time, a bit of a waste of paper. We spent a lot of time looking at the results and actually realised that thumbing through a long paper document isn't particularly useful and is not actually feasible in practice. So the other thing you find is when you've got piles of data on paper, at some point in the working week somebody's got to enter these data to a computer. And the \"eureka!\" moment, really, was when I was sitting there working through a pile of paper, and I thought, why don't we get the patients to enter the data directly into a database? The danger with data that are collected by clinicians and recorded by clinicians in case notes is that it's interpreted. And so it's often very valuable -- and, clearly, talking to doctors and doctors talking to patients is a key element of the clinical assessment process. However, if you've got an objective measure and detailed measure of a patient's symptomatology before you see them, it's recorded independently, then it's a very powerful tool to support and enable a detailed, robust and valid assessment of their symptoms, quality of life, which then can inform clinical practice. In my area of gynaecology, urogynecology, I'm dealing with patients with very sensitive, somewhat taboo conditions; urinary incontinence, prolapse, and associated sexual dysfunction. ePAQ really helps to explore those issues with patients. Quite often, things like sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, they're very difficult to talk about. Patients often won't talk to their partners about it, may not be completely open with their GPs and with gynaecologists. So enabling that process and getting a good understanding of intimate issues actually proves very helpful and actually quite often uncovers symptoms and concerns that may not have even been recorded or considered prior to the questionnaire being used. The beauty of it within our practice is that it's actually an integral part of our day-to-day clinical practice. It's not a burden to us to do this, it actually adds value. So we're actually doing something that's previously perceived as being burdensome, i.e. filling in questionnaires and collecting data. But actually, that adds value to the clinical process. So it actually makes that whole process more meaningful and valuable. But actually, having set out to improve the quality of our outcome measures in our practice, what I've actually developed is something that improves communication with my patients. And I think a lot of clinicians who use ePAQ find that actually it improves communication and therefore the clinical care they're able to provide. So the original aim of ePAQ was to improve the quality of data collection for outcomes monitoring. Actually, one of the most valuable aspects of ePAQ use from my perspective is a better understanding of my patients and their conditions and their concerns."}, {"id": 3974, "actor": "Data Handling & Parsing Techniques", "prompt": "I want you to act as a Python Pandas Syntax Coding Teacher.
