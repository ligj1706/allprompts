Mark Selby, the champion of the past two years, has been comprehensively beaten in the first round, 10-4 by Joe Perry. Ronnie O’Sullivan had to mount a mighty comeback himself, winning seven of the final eight frames to knock out Stephen Maguire 10-7. The opening weekend has already made the matter of who will claim the title an open one but it is not the only intriguing question at the Crucible this year.", "Two weeks ago the sporting impresario Barry Hearn, who among other things has a controlling interest in the commercial operations of snooker’s governing body, announced he would be raising the prize money for a 147 maximum at the Crucible this year. The bonus, which had been based on a slightly complicated rollover system with a minimum reward of £5,000, will now default to £40,000. It is a big raise to counter a striking anomaly: in recent years snooker has gone 147‑loopy everywhere bar the world championship.", "The basics of the snooker maximum require a player to make a clean sweep of the table, with every red that is potted being followed by a black. Established in the 1870s, with the first world championship taking place in 1927, snooker’s first recorded maximum came in 1955. It was scored by Joe Davis, the 15‑times world champion, and took two years before it was officially recognised. The first maximum in professional competition, meanwhile, did not come until 1982 when Steve Davis made the score in the Lada Classic in Oldham. To commemorate his accomplishment Davis was presented with a Lada with the customised numberplate of SD 147.", "The story of the snooker maximum accelerated from that point. To date there have been 139 scores of 147 in professional snooker. Of that total 70 have come since the turn of the decade and three have come in the past four weeks. The Chinese player Liang Wenbo scored one in world championship qualifying and nearly reached another two frames later, only to fail on the final black.", "O’Sullivan has the most 147s of any player, 14. The total includes the most feted maximum of all, scored against Mick Price in the first round of the 1997 world championship, a feat which took five minutes and 20 seconds to complete. When Sullivan made that break he was rewarded with a bonus of £147,000. Given the increasing frequency of the achievement, it is perhaps not surprising the prize money shrank. But there has not been a maximum at the world championship since Stephen Hendry cleaned the table against Stuart Bingham in 2012. The appetite to see an end to the barren run even led to O’Sullivan being suspected of having swerved one on purpose last year. Potting a pink after the final red when – in some eyes – it was possible for him to have screwed back for the black, Sullivan’s actions were deemed a protest against the insubstantial prize pot.", "Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: When was the first recorded maximum in snooker and who achieved it?"]}, {"id": 26083, "title": "Cooking & Healthy Eating", "content": ["Create a comprehensive and detailed menu of unique burger toppings that can be easily customized to cater to various dietary restrictions and preferences.

Answer according to: Julie Nelson and Nancy Hedin of the Moose Lake Post Prom Committee requested a donation from the Moose Lake City Council at its meeting Wednesday, April 8. The council members approved a $300 donation from the newly-formed contribution fund approved earlier this year. This is the first donation from the fund, which receives funding from pull-tabs at the Moose Lake Municipal Liquor Store. This year's outing will be held at Mont du Lac Chalet in the east Duluth area. Dave Johnson, during the public comment section of the meeting, spoke about his concerns regarding tax increment financing and the possible construction of new apartments in Moose Lake. He expressed concerns that what the city needs is more jobs, not tax increment financing for new apartments. He stated concerns that taxes on his Lake Shore Manor apartments and the Paul Rouche apartments have risen dramatically. He said he has no concern with conventional buildings going up without tax increment financing, but wants to see businesses that will offer jobs in the city. Rich Maxfield, superintendent of Moose Lake Power and Light, spoke to the council regarding the upcoming electrical line work that will be done in Moose Lake. The power lines that run from Douglas Avenue to Birch Avenue, between 3rd Street and 5th Street will be removed and replaced with underground lines. A transformer box will be located on 4th Street just west of Birch. Pedestals will be placed on 4th and 5th, with one pedestal servicing two homes. The pedestals will be placed on the property line near the street. The underground wiring will be pulled through electrical piping and will not disturb the property located at these sites. Brian Weidenforf of Land and Lease, developer of Moose Lake's Opportunity Park, spoke with the council regarding wetland credits and water/sewer piping. Weidendorf has been meeting with Carlton County regarding a wetland credits purchase, instead of Moose Lake wetland credits. However, he is able to use 8-inch ductile iron pipe (DIP) that Moose Lake has in storage. Weidendorf, City Administrator Pat Oman and the council are negotiating the costs of streetlights for the Opportunity Park project. The city wants decorative streetlights to match Arrowhead Lane. Weidendorf is willing to pay for regular street lighting, if the city is willing to pay the extra cost for special street lighting. Discussions will continue. A discussion was held regarding a letter received from Kwik Trip regarding the convenience store it is planning to construct at Opportunity Park. The letter addresses the planned construction of a storm water pond for the proposed site. There will be certain storm water features that will be incorporated into the site by Kwik Trip, to provide proper handling of storm water. A new pipe outfall will be constructed that will carry the majority of the storm water from the site. A sump catch basin manhole equipped with a SNOUT oil/water separator will be used for storm water draining from the fueling areas to provide pretreatment of storm water prior to discharging to the pond. A meeting regarding rural aging was held on March 26 at the home of Rita Baresh to discuss issues facing the elderly in the city of Moose Lake. Transportation was listed as one of the top priorities. A White House listening session is set for Thursday, May 14 from 2:30-5 p.m. at the depot community center. It will be a listening session and people can come, give their input, and then leave. Catherine Sampson of the Arrowhead Area Agency on Aging is setting up the session. Mayor Ted Shaw attended the meeting and brought the information to the council. Council members discussed transportation for the elderly and the feasibility of a bus system within Moose Lake. This has been done previously, but was stopped in 2008 because there was only one person using the service. The council will discuss this idea further at its next meeting. Joe Rhein, city engineer, and Brian Guldan, environment project engineer, spoke regarding the wastewater treatment facility upgrades. The city had previously approved upgrades to the current system. However, Guldan spoke to the council regarding the addition of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to the wastewater facility treatment project. SCADA consists of hardware, software and communication systems that can control, monitor and log data for the lift stations and various other types of processes in the water and wastewater treatment facility. Maxfield stated SCADA was used in Wilmar with excellent results. City personnel can access the data from smart phones or tablets to determine what needs to be done, and program the changes that need to be made from their phone or tablet. SCADA will save approximately 1.5 man-hours every day. The system was approved by the council. The council also approved the addition of a stand-alone, diesel-powered backup generator for the new lift stations. The generator would prevent any backup of sewage during power outages in the community. Approval was given for the purchase and installation of diaper changing stations in the men’s and women’s bathrooms in the public area by the library in the city building. The next regular meeting of the Moose Lake City Council will be held on Wednesday, May 13 at 6:30 p.m. in the city council chamber."]}, {"id": 26093, "title": "Job Application & Customer Management", "content": ["Write a heartfelt letter to a specific team member that includes specific examples of their hard work that you appreciated.

For now... a few of my favs. I had a fun time getting to know you and watch the two of you together! I don't think I'm fully recovered yet, but I just had to get the fabulous memories I shared with the Nix and Zachry Families up on my blog. I drove back this afternoon with roses and candels and kisses on the brain. I had such a great time! It was such a wonderful celebration with smiles GALORE! So much fun to share and so many family and friends. It started with an AMAZING rehearsal dinner, bigger than many receptions I've witnessed and that's when I knew that this couple was going to have a BIG wedding. Saturday, 7 PM arrived and the Frist Baptist Church in Midland was packed in the middle with little room to spare. So many family and friends came to share in such a wonderful celebration. I love that Casey and Allison made time for each and everyone of them, as exhausting as that may have been, I don't think they would have had it any other way. View the complete sneak peek, HERE. Casey and the boys enjoyed a round or two of golf on a beautful clear day! Enough clouds in the sky to keep the sun at bay. Flowers were quite lovely and I had the chance to play with a few in one of the sunday school rooms. Doesn't take much to make these babies look good. Allison is such a sweet person. She found the time in the busy days of planning a wedding to personally hand write thank you notes to those in her bridal party. And heart felt, sincere notes at that. She's just that type of person and I think one of her traits that Casey admires. He was heard telling the \"boys in the boys room\" that he knows it's right. \"She's such a blessing to him.\" Melt my heart! The amazing gown! All the way from New York! Allison a second before walking down that long ailse. Okay, I can't wait any longer and since she's going to married today by the time this post publishes, I'm sharing! I don't get to post brides on the blog much and I was so thrilled with this session, I told myself that when the wedding was over, I was posting. I visited the Cohen family before I left for Midland on Friday. I'm happy to report that Rachel still has her hair! It's a dark, deep brown and her eyes are definitely blue. She was having a bit of a tummy ache, but still managed to steal my heart and make me feel all good about the world again. i got him again! How lucky is that?

YOUNG, et al., Petitioners,v.Ernest Eugene HARPER.", "No. 95-1598.", "Supreme Court of the United States", "Argued Dec. 9, 1996.", "Decided March 18, 1997.", "Syllabus", "*", "Oklahoma's Preparole Conditional Supervision Program (preparole or Program) took effect whenever the state prisons became overcrowded and authorized the conditional release of prisoners before their sentences expired.  The Pardon and Parole Board determined who could participate in it, and an inmate could be placed on preparole after serving 15% of his sentence.  An inmate was eligible for parole only after one-third of his sentence had elapsed, and the Governor, based on the Board's recommendation, decided to grant parole.  Program participants and parolees were released subject to similar constraints.  Upon reviewing respondent's criminal record and prison conduct, the Board simultaneously recommended him for parole and released him under the Program.  At that time, he had served 15 years of a life sentence.  After he spent five apparently uneventful months outside the penitentiary, the Governor denied him parole, whereupon he was ordered to, and did, report back to prison. Despite his claim that his summary reincarceration deprived him of liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, he was denied habeas relief by, successively, the state trial court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Federal District Court.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, holding  that preparole was sufficiently like parole that a Program participant was entitled to the procedural protections set forth  in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484.", "Held: The Program, as it existed when respondent was released, was equivalent to parole as understood in Morrissey.  Morrissey's description of the \"nature of the interest of the parolee in his continued liberty'' could just as easily have applied to respondent while he was on preparole.  In compliance with state procedures, he was released from prison before the expiration of his sentence.  See 408 U.S., at 477, 92 S.Ct., at 2598.  He kept his own residence; he sought, obtained, and maintained a job; and he lived a life generally free of the incidents of imprisonment. See id., at 481-482, 92 S.Ct., at 2600-01.  Although he was not permitted to use alcohol, to incur other than educational debt, or to travel outside the county without permission, and he was required to report regularly to a parole officer, similar limits on a parolee's liberty did not in Morrissey render such liberty beyond procedural protection. Id., at 478, 92 S.Ct., at 2598-2599. Some of the factors asserted by petitioners to differentiate the Program from parole under Meachum v. Fano, 427  U.S. 215, 228, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 2540, 49 L.Ed.2d 451-that preparole had the purpose of reducing prison overcrowding, and that a preparolee continued to serve his sentence and receive earned credits, remained within the custody of the Department of Corrections, and was aware that he could have been transferred to a higher security level if the Governor denied parole-do not, in  fact, appear to distinguish the two programs at all.  Other differences identified by petitioners-that participation in the Program was ordered by the Board, while the Governor conferred parole; that escaped preparolees could be prosecuted as though they had escaped from prison, while escaped parolees were subject only to parole revocation, and that a preparolee could not leave  Oklahoma under any circumstances, while a parolee could leave the State with his parole officer's permission-serve only to set preparole apart from the specific terms of parole as it existed in Oklahoma, but not from the more general class of parole identified in Morrissey. The Program appears to have differed from parole in name alone. Pp. ____-____.", "64 F.3d 563 (CA 10 1995), affirmed.", "THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.", "Sandra D.

We hold that the program, as it appears to have been structured at the time respondent was placed on it, differed from parole in name alone, and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.", "2", "* As pertinent to this case, Oklahoma operated two programs under which inmates were conditionally released from prison before the expiration of their sentences.  One was parole, the other was the Preparole Conditional Supervision Program (preparole or Program).  The Program was in effect whenever the population of the prison system exceeded 95% of its capacity.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, §365(A) (Supp.1990).  An inmate could be placed on preparole after serving 15% of his sentence, Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, §365(A)(2) (Supp.1990), and he was eligible for parole when one-third of his sentence had elapsed, Okla. Stat., Tit. 57 §332.7(A) (Supp.1990).  The Pardon and Parole Board had a role in the placement of both parolees and preparolees.  The Board itself determined who could participate in the Program, while the Governor, based on the Board's recommendation, decided  whether a prisoner would be paroled.  As we describe further in Part II, infra, participants in the Program were released subject to constraints similar to those imposed on parolees.", "3", "In October 1990, after reviewing respondent Ernest Eugene Harper's criminal record and conduct while incarcerated, the Pardon and Parole Board simultaneously recommended him for parole and released him under the Program.  At that time, respondent had served 15 years of a life sentence for two murders.  Before his release, respondent underwent orientation, during which he reviewed the \"Rules and Conditions of Pre-Parole Conditional Supervision,'' see App. 7, and after which he executed a document indicating that he \"underst[ood] that being classified to community level depend[ed] upon [his] compliance with each of these expectations,'' App. 6.  He spent five apparently uneventful months outside the penitentiary.  Nonetheless, the Governor of Oklahoma denied respondent parole.  On March 14, 1991, respondent was telephoned by his parole officer, informed of the Governor's decision, and told to report back to prison, which he did later that day.", "4", "Respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state court complaining that his summary return to prison had deprived him of liberty without due process.  The state trial court denied relief and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. 852 P.2d 164 (Okla.Crim.App.1993).  The Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that respondent's removal from the Program impinged only upon an interest in his \"degree of confinement,'' an interest to which the procedural protections set out in Morrissey did not attach. Id., at 165.  The court found \" [d]ispositive of the issue'' the fact that respondent \"was not granted parole by the Governor of Oklahoma.'' Ibid. The  court noted that the Board had adopted a procedure under which preparolees subsequently denied parole remained on the Program, and had their cases reviewed within 90 days of the denial for a determination whether they should continue on preparole. According to the court, \"such a procedure gives an inmate sufficient notice when he is placed in the program that he may be removed from it when the governor exercises his discretion and declines to grant parole.'' Ibid.", "5", "Respondent fared no better in District Court on his petition for relief under 28 U.S.C. §2254.  But the Tenth Circuit reversed. 64 F.3d 563 (1995).  It determined that preparole \"more closely resembles parole or probation than even the more permissive forms of institutional confinement'' and that \" [d]ue  process therefore mandates that program participants receive at least the procedural protections described in Morrissey. '' Id.,  at 566-567. Petitioners sought certiorari on the limited question whether preparole \"is more similar to parole or minimum  security imprisonment; and, thus, whether continued participation in such program is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.''  Pet. for Cert. i.  We granted certiorari, 517 U.S. ____, 116 S.Ct. 1846, 134 L.Ed.2d 948 (1996), and, because we find that preparole as it existed at the  time of respondent's release was equivalent to parole as understood in Morrissey, we affirm.1", "II", "6", "DB1S\"The essence of parole is release from prison, before the completion of sentence, on the condition that the prisoner abide by certain rules during the balance of the sentence.'' Morrissey, 408 U.S., at 477, 92 S.Ct., at 2598.  In Morrissey, we described the \"nature of the interest of the parolee in his continued liberty'':", "7", "\" [H]e can be gainfully employed and is free to be with      family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments      of normal life.  Though the State properly subjects him to      many restrictions not applicable to other citizens, his      condition is very different from that of confinement in a      prison . . . .   The parolee has relied on  at least an      implicit promise that parole will be revoked only if he fails      to live up to the parole conditions.'' Id., at 482, 92 S.Ct.,      at 2600-2601.", "8", "This passage could just as easily have applied to respondent while he was on preparole.  In compliance with state procedures,  he was released from prison before the expiration of his sentence.  He kept his own residence; he sought, obtained, and maintained a job; and he lived a life generally free of the incidents of imprisonment.  To be sure, respondent's liberty was  not unlimited.  He was not permitted to use alcohol, to incur other than educational debt, or to travel outside the county without permission.  App. 7-8.  And he was required to report regularly to a parole officer. Id., at 7.  The liberty of a parolee is similarly limited, but that did not in Morrissey, 408  U.S., at 478, 92 S.Ct., at 2598-2599, render such liberty beyond procedural protection.", "9", "Petitioners do not ask us to revisit Morrissey; they merely dispute that preparole falls within its compass.  Our inquiry, they argue, should be controlled instead by Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976).  There, we determined that the interest of a prisoner in avoiding an intrastate prison transfer was \"too ephemeral and insubstantial to trigger procedural due process protections as long as prison officials have discretion to transfer him for whatever reason or for no reason at all.'' Id., at 228, 96 S.Ct., at 2540; see also Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. ____, ____, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 2297, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).  Petitioners contend that reincarceration of a preparolee was nothing more than a \"transfe[r] to a higher degree of confinement'' or a \"classification to a more supervised prison environment,'' Brief for Petitioners 18, which, like transfers within the prison setting, involved no liberty interest.", "10", "In support of their argument that preparole was merely a lower security classification and not parole, petitioners identify several aspects of the Program said to render it different from parole.  Some of these do not, in fact, appear to  distinguish the two programs.  Others serve only to set preparole apart from the specific terms of parole as it existed in Oklahoma, but not from the more general class of parole identified in Morrissey. None of the differences-real or imagined-supports a view of the Program as having been anything other than parole as described in Morrissey.", "11", "We first take up the phantom differences.  We are told at the outset that the purposes of preparole and parole were different. Preparole was intended \"to reduce prison overcrowding'' while parole was designed \"to help reintegrate the inmate into society.''  Reply Brief for Petitioners 10.  This alleged difference is less than it seems.  Parole could also be employed to reduce prison over-crowding, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 57 §332.7(B) (Supp.1990).  And, the Program's requirement that its participants work or attend school belies the notion that preparole was concerned only with moving bodies outside of teeming prison yards.  In fact, in their brief below, petitioners described the Program as one in which the Department of Corrections \"places eligible inmates into a community for the purpose of reintegration into society.''  Brief for Appellees in No. 95-5026 (CA10), p. 7, n. 2.", "12", "We are also told that \"an inmate on the Program continues to serve his sentence and receives earned credits  . . . , whereas a parolee is not serving his sentence and, if parole is revoked, the parolee is not entitled to deduct from his sentence time spent on parole.''  Reply Brief for Petitioners 11.  Our review of the statute in effect when respondent was released, however, reveals that a parolee was \"entitled to a deduction from his sentence for all time during which he has been or may be on parole'' and that, even when parole was revoked, the Board had the discretion to credit time spent on parole against the sentence.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, §350 (Supp.1990).", "13", "Petitioners next argue that preparolees, unlike parolees, remained within the custody of the Department of Corrections. This is said to be evidenced by respondent's having had to report to his parole officer weekly and to provide the officer with a weekly itinerary.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 13.  We are at a loss to explain why respondent's regular visits to his parole officer rendered him more \"in custody'' than a parolee, who was required to make similar visits.  See App. to Brief for Respondent 28a.  Likewise, the provision that preparolees \"be subject to disciplinary proceedings as established by the Department of Corrections'' in the event that they \"violate any rule or condition during the period of community supervision,'' Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, §365(E) (Supp.1990), did not distinguish their \"custodial'' status from that of parolees, who were also subject to the Department's custody in the event of a parole violation. See Reply Brief for Petitioners 13.", "14", "Petitioners, for their final non-existent distinction, argue that, because a preparolee \"is aware that he may be transferred to a higher security level if the Governor, through his discretionary power, denies parole,'' he does not enjoy the same  liberty interest as a parolee.  Brief for Petitioners 20.  Preparole, contend petitioners, was thus akin to a furlough program, in which liberty was not conditioned on the participant's behavior but on extrinsic events.  By this reasoning, respondent would have lacked the \"implicit promise'' that his liberty would continue so long as he complied with the conditions of his release, Morrissey, 408 U.S., at 482, 92 S.Ct., at 2601.  Respondent concedes the reasoning of petitioners' argument as it relates to furloughs, but challenges the premise that his participation in the Program was conditioned on the Governor's decision regarding parole.", "15", "In support of their assertion that a preparolee knew that a denial of parole could result in reincarceration, petitioners rely-as they have throughout this litigation-on a procedure promulgated in August 1991, nearly five months after respondent was returned to prison.  See Pardon and Parole Board Procedure No. 004-011 (1991), App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a.2 The Court of Criminal Appeals also relied on this provision, but because it was not in effect when respondent was released, it has little relevance to this case.", "16", "Nor have we been presented with any other evidence to substantiate this asserted limitation on respondent's release. The closest petitioners come is to direct us to the orientation form reviewed with respondent upon his release.  Item 9 of that orientation form says: \"Reviewed options available in the event of parole denial.''  App. 5.  Mindful of Procedure No. 004-011, as amended after respondent was reincarcerated, it is possible to read this item as indicating that respondent was told his participation in the Program could be terminated if parole were denied.  But the mere possibility of respondent's having been so informed is insufficient to overcome his showing of the facially complete, written \"Rules and Conditions of Pre-Parole Conditional Supervision,'' App. 7-9, which said nothing about the effect of a parole denial.", "17", "Counsel for the State also claims that at the time respondent was participating in the Program, preparolees were always reincarcerated if the Governor denied them parole.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In the absence of evidence to this effect-and the State points to none-this assertion is insufficient to rebut the seemingly complete Rules and Conditions of respondent's release. On the record before us, therefore, the premise of petitioners' argument-that respondent's continued participation was conditioned on extrinsic events-is illusory, and the analogy to furlough inapposite.3", "18", "Petitioners do identify some actual differences between preparole and Oklahoma's version of parole, but these do no better at convincing us that preparole was different from parole  as we understood it in Morrissey. As petitioners point out, participation in the Program was ordered by the Board, while the Governor conferred parole.  In this regard, preparole was different from parole in Oklahoma; but it was no different from parole as we described it in Morrissey. See 408 U.S., at 477-478, 92 S.Ct., at 2598-2599.  In addition, preparolees who \"escape[d]'' from the Program could be prosecuted as though they  had escaped from prison, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, §365(F) (Supp.1990), while it appears that parolees who \"escaped'' from parole were subject not to further prosecution, but to revocation of parole, see Reply Brief for Petitioners 11.  That the punishment for failure to abide by one of the conditions of his liberty was potentially greater for a preparolee than for a parolee did not itself diminish that liberty.  Petitioners also note that a preparolee could not leave Oklahoma under any circumstances, App. 7, while a parolee could leave Oklahoma with  his parole officer's permission, App. to Brief for Respondent 27a.  This minor difference in a released prisoner's ability to travel did not, we think, alter the fundamentally parole-like nature of the Program.4", "III", "19", "We conclude that the Program, as it existed when respondent was released, was a kind of parole as we understood parole in Morrissey.5 The judgment of the Tenth Circuit is therefore affirmed.", "20", "It is so ordered.", "*", "The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

We disagree.  A timely filed petition for rehearing will toll the running of the 90-day period for filing a petition for certiorari until disposition of the rehearing petition. Missouri v.

Although the petition for rehearing was filed two days late, the Tenth Circuit granted petitioners \"leave to file a late petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en banc,'' as it had authority to do.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a). Moreover, after granting petitioners leave to file the petition for rehearing, the Tenth Circuit treated it as timely and no mandate issued until after the petition was denied.  See Fed.

In these circumstances, we are satisfied that both the petition for rehearing and the subsequent petition for certiorari were timely filed.", "2", "The version of Procedure No. 004-011 in effect when respondent was placed on the Program was silent as to a parole denial's effect.

The Earth's magnetosphere is a barrier to the solar winds, and forces the charged particles of the solar wind to flow around the magnetosphere itself. But in the polar regions, the magnetic lines of force of the Earth and of the solar wind bunch together. Here many of the solar wind's charged particles break through the magnetosphere and enter Earth's magnetic field. They then spiral back and forth between the Earth's magnetic poles very rapidly. In the polar regions, electrons from the solar wind ionize and excite the atoms and molecules of the upper atmosphere, causing them to emit aurora radiations of visible light.", "The colors of an aurora depend on the atoms emitting them.
