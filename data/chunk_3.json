delicious more in balance and slightly fancier version of a sloppy joe think of it as a sloppy joe with its shirt tucked in or a sloppy Joseph let's call it that to get started I need to experience the standard issue cafeteria sloppy joe to see if it's as bad as I remember for that I've got a good old-fashioned can of Manwich here by the way Manwich is a sick name for a product but looking at this ingredient label I'm not super excited to try it two out of the first four ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and plain corn syrup straight out of the can though it actually doesn't taste that bad it's kind of like if you added ketchup to Taco Bell mild sauce now to make it sloppy I'll follow the four step instructions on the can step one is cook beef thoroughly for that I'll just Brown off a pound of ground beef in a non-stick pan then step two add Manwich sauce now the can doesn't say to do this but I cooked this sauce down a little bit so that it wasn't so soupy and then step three is to ask to be called Chef by everyone who addresses you that's awesome I assume it's because your sloppy joes are just going to be so freaking sick that they have no choice and then step four is to serve dig in and leave hunger behind oh I got it this tastes like an overly ketchup hamburger from McDonald's just kind of uh Bland ground beef with tons of corn syrup and tomato product yum honestly it's a pretty low bar so of course we can do better to get started I'll need one pound of ground beef I prefer to use 80 20 here because leaner meat would not be unctuous enough next I'll drop my meat into a bowl and then add one gram or a quarter teaspoon of baking soda this soda is going to help inhibit the beef proteins from bonding together while they cook making the beef nice and tender one of my main gripes with sloppy joes is that the meat tends to be tough and gristly and it gets stuck in your teeth also if you're wondering if more soda here would make the beef more tender I tried that and made this recipe with 4 grams instead of one and Not only was this version borderline mushy the extra soda raised the pH in the sauce so much that it caramelized a lot more than it should have and it had a really weird unwelcome dark flavor to it moral the story is some soda good a lot of soda bad and very weird now I'm gonna let this beef sit for a second while I bust out some quick knife work for that I've got one onion and one poblano pepper for the onion I'm gonna go with a small ish dice here too big and the onions won't melt into the sauce and they'll Stand Out texture really in a way that I don't like in total I'll need 150 grams of onion for the papano I'll also go with a pretty small dice here and I'm using it over a more traditional green bell pepper because it brings some mellow heat and has a lot more green chili flavor I'll need 100 grams of poblano once I've got my veggies diced I'll grab a large non-stick pan and drop it on the stove over medium-high heat and once that's hot I'll add in a good long squeezer of olive oil and then in goes my onions my poblanos and then a strong pinch of salt from there I'll jump in and Fry these two together to soften them up a little bit and to get some color going around the edges that'll take about three to four minutes with pretty frequent stirring and once the aromatics are softened up and starting to take on some color I'll add in my soded beef from there I'll jump back in with my ground meat musher to spread it out and break it down by the way this musher is one of only two or three single purpose tools that I keep in my tool drawer in my opinion it doesn't much much better job at crumbling meat down than a spatula or a potato masher and it's very worth the five dollars it cost now I'll continue to smush this meat for two to three minutes or however long it takes to break it down into very small particles smaller ground beef particles not only have more surface area to catch that flavorful sloppy joe sauce but they're also better to eat and after about four minutes this meat is starting to take on some nice Browning it's cooked through and most importantly we've got it crumbled down into an edible size so next comes some seasoning in goes five grams of salt 5 grams of onion powder 5 grams of garlic powder 2 grams of black pepper 5 grams of paprika and then a strong pinch of chili flakes next I'll give that a toss to combine and then fry the spices with the meat and veggies to open up their flavors that'll take about 30 seconds or so and once I'm there I'll add in 10 grams of all-purpose flour and then stir that in this flour is going to help thicken the sauce a little bit and also help emulsify the beef fat later on so our Josephs won't be overly greasy and once the flour is stirred in enough to hydrate it and the raw flavor has been cooked off I'll add in my wet ingredients that's going to be 50 grams of tomato paste 50 grams of ketchup 15 grams of yellow mustard 15 grams of brown sugar 50 grams of worch or as I like to call it were chest ER sure Worcestershire call it whatever you want but in my opinion sloppy Josephs are just as much about worch as they are about the ketchup so I use a lot next I'll add in 20 grams of red wine vinegar and then this won't be surprising I'm gonna add in a little bit of better than bouillon beef paste about 10 grams lastly I'll add in 350 grams of any kind of store-bought stock and then I'll jump in and stir to get everything combined and once we're looking Saucy I'll bring this sauce up to a simmer reduce the heat to medium low and then think made in the sponsor of this video for making such a dope non-stick pan if you haven't heard of Maiden they're a cookware brand that partners with multi-generational factories and Artisans to help bring you a curated collection of materials and shapes that you need in your kitchen over the last year I've switched most of my cookware over to maiden and that's not just because they're a sponsor and I got some of it for free I mean that part was nice but I like the first few pieces that I got so much that I went out and spent some of my own money on a few more maiden's professional quality products are made for the home cook but their kitchenware is all also used in multiple Michelin starred restaurants because it's professional quality this 12-inch non-stick pan that I'm using in this video and all of maiden's non-stick products use the same composition of their five-ply stainless steel line that I love the non-stick surface is double cured made without pfoa it's non-toxic it's super easy to clean and bonus its oven safe up to 500 f plus it's held up really well for me which is amazing because I'm super hard on my cookware check out maiden's non-stick cookware using the link in my description for a limited time they're offering viewers of this video 15 off their first order with my link now for about 10 minutes I'm going to reduce the cooking liquid while also coming back intermittently with my meat musher to break the beef down even further cooking the meat with wet heat kind of braises it and allows the fat inside to render more fully making it more tender combine that with the soda and we're going to have very luscious very tender beef and after about 10 to 12 minutes of reduction when I come back and push my spatula through the sauce you can see it leaves a pretty wide Gap there's there's also going to be a bunch of beef fat sitting on top and that's totally okay just give this a vigorous stir and the AP flower that we used earlier will emulsify that fat into the sauce and you guys don't under reduce this sauce either if it's too loose the meat mixture won't hold itself together and it will literally just crumble off the sandwich into a pile on your plate that's too sloppy now the last step is to taste for salt levels and I think we got it babe let's try it real good now to make this into a sandwich I'll drop a non-stick pan over medium heat from there I'll brush a liberal amount of melted butter on the inside of a squishy store-bought brioche bun these little brioche joints are widely available and exceptionally soft way better for this sandwich in my opinion than those stale dry quote hamburger buns not for my burger bro next I'll pop my buttered bun in the pan and then give it a light toast on both sides this is going to bring some much needed crispiness to a sandwich that is normally just pure soft and once I've caught a little crisp around the edges like this I'll pull it out next I'll drop four to six ounces of my meat mixture and then I'll attempt to mitigate slop here by tidying the meat a little bit my hope is that piling it tall and tight will keep most of it on the bun and off of my wrist slash plate and there we go a not so sloppy sloppy joe oop I'll just tuck that in a little bit I'm in control here Joe or should I say Joseph wow you've really matured it used to be a total mess of a sandwich but now your beefy Savory a little bit spicy a little bit sweet and perfectly in Balance textually this sandwich is so different from the Joe's of your pass it's tender and juicy isn't the right word but I'll say pleasantly moist it's just a deluxe version of an otherwise very unglamorous sandwich and it's so much more flavorful than I expected let's

And spending my first few years in a firetrap tenement of a human district at Three Points East, I knew what “worse” looked like. \n\nSo you take ratings. Wash, rinse, repeat. I was always good at math, and fixing things, and managed to pick up a couple of local languages, like Tradetongue and Novayan - most of all I knew what streets to stay off of on my walk back from the market, and what not to wear in case I couldn’t stay off those streets. \n\nThen after Mama died, and we moved up to Perimeter One (where my grandmother lived), things changed. The big space station was lonely and austere much of the time but it was safe. It’s a lonely childhood but it’s not like you know better, because pretty much any other human children, doing the same thing, taking their Early ratings, sitting in the atrium by themselves while mom’s giving out tools at the station depot. But sometimes during Landing Day or Mars Day or Yuri’s Night it turns into a weeklong party, an inversion festival if you will. \n\nAnd that’s how I found out, that whatever station I happened to be at, there were other parts of the station. On Perimeter One, I would walk, and take the freight lift down to the Nadiran quarter. There it was clean, and quiet, and everybody usually just went about their thing. I strained to listen to their language and learned quickly to duck behind a pylon before I was seen. They leaned over in their dark robes, speaking barely above a whisper, making deals, and after straining my eyes I learned to pick up a bit of the hand signs they used in their haggling. \n\nI rated onto my first Massive Container Transport at 16, as a trainee. That’s when people started calling me “Sparks,” not once in that whole trip did anyone remember my name. I thought stationside would be different with cred on my stick, no such luck.\n\nI tried to hook up in port a few times, wanted to see what all the fuss was about, turns out alcohol can make anything happen. Mostly though I just didn’t know how to pass the time after the depots and library branches were closed. Didn’t know what to do with company anyway, so mostly in port I just laid low. \n\nBut… I just… nothing ever really happened, not at any stop, year after year; somehow it’s like I was standing on the sidelines, my syndics all shuffled off to their families and friends. None of that had happened for me, somehow whatever it was when we were on the ship, disappeared in port. \n\nSo at 20, when I had the chance to rate in ansible and work a ringship between the Destruction system and the Port West system, I took it. That’s why I became an intersystem spacer, because I was already out of sync anyway, had no family, had no one. Time loss wouldn’t mean a thing to me, nobody knew I was alive. Some Light Chasers get addicted to the feeling of… when I get back, how badly will shit have changed. Some of us just love that every time we get back, the food’s better than whatever we left behind. A few months to us, but meanwhile, downworld they’ve had years to get their shit together. \n\nNot like any sensible person with a family would ever make a life of this. It’s not just a way to run away from your problems, nobody downworld wants to deal with it. One or two trips, that’s one thing: especially when you’re young. But you pick the life of the Light Chaser, for any length of time, because you got no family to begin with, and you don’t want one.\n\nMay as well see the next system over, right? Get me further away from the hole in the wall called Three Points East. I never thought much about the future. That had something to do with settling down in the communes and raising seaweed or something, whenever anyone talks about “the future of the Co-Op” they’re always talking about the people raising rugrats on AgCom 5 or something. People on the ground, they think about the future. For me, the future is happening whether I want to think about it or not. No time to think about it.\n\nAs a kid I was good at just a few things, staying out of the way and studying, and fending for myself, and not complaining. Above all, don’t complain. They won’t hear it. If you think this life ain’t much then it’s still an RCH better than joining a gang on Three Points East, or selling your body, or being a drug mule on Port West. If you’re a smart kid then this is your best chance at an actual life. Maybe even you put your feet dirtside and have a family. Your grandparents broke their bodies as asteroid miners to give you this, and shed blood to give you this. Your great grandfather or great grandmother stayed in a crimp on some hellhole station, just to get abducted away by corporate sleeper ship and cross light years in cold storage. All so you could have this, in relative safety, the routines are what they are, and so your own children (figuratively speaking) could do better still. Could always be much worse. \n\nYou could be on Earth. And in my years since, I learned there are places even worse, that make Earth look like a garden spot. Suffice it to say, seeing what I’ve seen since, I might take Earth over any of them.\nENTRY 3\n\nSo the thing about long distance transport is that it’s one of the best places to be a trainee. It’s got the most opportunities for rating and cross-training. You’re probably not gonna die too messily. If it’s a Massive Container Transport going between systems, you see the most people, and it’s still one of the least cramped of the ships in ItSyn’s complement, let alone the Co-Op’s as a whole. (An MCT is a belly-lander, detachable from its modular ring drive, but that’s beside the point.) This make and model of MCT, a second-generation, is the newest and cleanest and has the best filtration, and the most space. On a smaller ship, you’re smelling each other’s sweaty asscracks all day. MCTs on the other hand just kind of always smell like hand cleaner and engine grease. MCTs are the smoothest ride, the newest components. \nThe Intersystem Transport Syndicate has the best facilities, the best security. You can license your own ship and run a commercial service under the auspices of the Co-Op, sure, but on a lot of things you’re just gonna be on your own. And that’s how lots of people like it.\nBut you gotta get from here to there, and if you’re from Three Points East like me, then the extra cred working for ItSyn is how you get there. The MCTs have the best facilities, with two big hab rings for in-system (longest parts of a trip). Before we make jump between systems, you make sure you got your belongings off because we’re going to be leaving the hab rings behind. On we go into the drive frame, we lock in, on goes the A-drive and control units, and then the pre-jump checks before spin up, and that’s a longer procedure than I’m going to bother to walk you through, but everything’s got to be snug and everything’s got to be balanced. Then you take your meds and get into your liquid filled intersystem crash couches. A jump takes absolutely precision usage of fuel, more than any other maneuver, because you don’t want to overshoot your target and plow into a star. Takes a big thrust to spin up, the hardest you’ll pull Gs on any trip short of leaving dirtside. I know you were hoping for some kind of warp drive technobabble, or to hear about monsters or some bullshit. Sorry I can’t make it a better story.\n\nThat’s the hardest part of a jump. It’s not even the spin-up. That happens fast, and smooth. You feel nothing. Nothing even shifts as the ripple in spacetime moves around you and you push through it. Some of my syndics called that part hitting the halfpipe, don’t know where that’s even from.\nJust get in, sit down, shut up, and hang on.\n\\*\\*\nThe best part of an MCT is the privacy. The newer MCT habs have “soundproof” individual compartments with sliding doors, so if your habmates are like mine and always having visitors over, then you’re going to be grateful for that. If the visitor is a certain Novayan, then it’s probably not going to be enough.\nThat Novayan was one K’Ratha, an FNG working in the hold, better known for his sack skills than anything else. He’d come aboard with some other Novayans a month back, but none were as popular as him (there were a couple of quieter males and a grumpy female). K’Ratha made the rounds in my hab multiple times on each leg of the trip, and this was going to be a long one. Apparently he was quite in demand, and the soundproofing wasn’t enough. Ended up just laying with my noise-cancelers on and the pillow over my head. This was going to be a long trip.\nWhen I finally saw him in line in the mess, there was another Novayan with him, and overhearing the conversation between them, I had the impression that our K’Ratha thought his ears and whiskers were gonna buy him some automatic cred on the lanes. The other Novayan – bigger, with broader shoulders - crossed his arms and glowered down at K’Ratha, shaking his head. “It’s rude, K’Ratha,” he said, his voice a shade deeper than the other’s, “To speak in Novayan in front of the humans. Why do you have to be such a walking stereotype, ay?”\n“Rreh. Thanna rrala the,” I said.\nThe bigger Novayan reached up and smacked the back of K’Ratha’s head.\n“I apologize for my brother,” he said, bowing his head slightly.\nNow, I’d never seen this Novayan before, despite the fact that he’d come on with K’Ratha, and was surprised at his aura of general formality.\nThe two Novayans looked similar, bigger though this one was. They both had coppery fur with dark stripes and swirls, and black noses.\nThe patches on the bigger Novayan’s flight suit read NAV SPEC III, and he had a bunch more additional rating patches on his flight suit and various fam candy, and his name patch read R’Kesh.\nI shook my head, and kept moving forward in the line to get my tray, thinking on whatever deal the Co-Op must’ve made with Seven Brothers Aqua to keep this many Novayan crewmates in this much space-farmed salmon.\n\n\\*\\*"}, {"id": 538, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "what is ecological niche"}, {"id": 539, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a short story about a group of travelers who stumble upon a village of telepathic animals, including a bear who can predict the future and a flock of talking birds who offer life advice."}, {"id": 540, "actor": "Mathematics & Algebra", "prompt": "Derive a formula to estimate the total cost of building a circular fence around a garden, given the radius and the price per unit length of the fencing material."}, {"id": 541, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "can you make a react component of half circle chart which take percentage as prop?"}, {"id": 542, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "make a task for git and github for freshsers"}, {"id": 543, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "With no explanation, label A→B with either \"not_related\" or \"related\".\nA: Dulquer Salmaan acted in a 2012 film.\nB: Ustad Hotel is a 2012 Indian Malayalam-language drama film directed by Anwar Rasheed , written by Anjali Menon and produced by Listin Stephen under the banner of Magic Frames ..

A pentomino, which is an arrangement of five connected squares chosen from a select set of possible pentominoes, appears at the top of the well. The pentomino falls straight down the well one square at a time. A pentomino cannot fall into a square already occupied by a previously fallen pentomino. When a pentomino can fall no further, a new pentomino appears at the top of the well and begins to fall. As pentominoes fall, a solid horizontal line without gaps may form.
