The defendant contends that it is not liable for copyright infringement because it makes fair use of the Works in Suit. See 17 U.S.C. § 107. The parties now crossmove for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant’s motion for summary judgment is denied.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The plaintiffs -- Hachette Book Group, Inc. (“Hachette”), HarperCollins Publishers LLC (“HarperCollins”), John Wiley & Sons., Inc. (“Wiley”), and Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin”) (together, the “Publishers”) -- are four of the leading book publishers in the United States. Pls.’ 56.1, ECF No. 113, ¶ 1. They obtain from authors the exclusive rights to publish books in print and digital formats, including electronic copies of books, or “ebooks.” Id. ¶¶ 63-68. Publishers and authors generally are paid for sales of each format in which a book is published. Id. ¶ 65. The defendant, Internet Archive (“IA”), is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing “universal access to all knowledge.” Def.’s 56.1, ECF No. 98, ¶¶ 1-2. Brewster Kahle, IA’s Chairman, founded the organization in 1996. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 216. One of IA’s first projects was to document the history of the Internet by archiving every public webpage on the World Wide Web through IA’s “Wayback Machine.” Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 5. IA also works with libraries, museums, universities, and the public to preserve and offer free online access to texts, audio, moving images, software, and other cultural artifacts. Id. ¶ 6.\n\nThis dispute concerns the way libraries lend ebooks. Public and academic libraries in the United States spend billions of dollars each year obtaining print books and ebooks for their patrons to borrow for free. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 113. Libraries usually buy their print books from publishers or wholesalers. Id. ¶ 114. Copies of ebooks, however, are typically not bought but licensed to libraries from publishers through distributors called “aggregators.” Id. ¶ 117. The Publishers task aggregators with ensuring that a library lends its ebooks only to the library’s members. Id. ¶¶ 123, 125. The Publishers also require aggregators to employ approved “digital rights management” (“DRM”) software and other security measures to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of ebook files. Id. ¶ 126. Demand for library ebooks has increased over the past decade. In 2012, OverDrive, the largest aggregator, processed 70 million digital checkouts of ebooks and audiobooks; by 2020, that number had risen to 430 million. Id. ¶¶ 119, 164.\n\nThe Publishers use several licensing models to profit from the distribution of ebooks to libraries. Id. ¶¶ 120, 122. All four Publishers offer a “one-copy, one-user” model: Libraries pay a single fee for an ebook and patrons check out a copy of that ebook successively, subject to community-based and DRM restrictions. Id. ¶ 127. Each Publisher offers academic libraries a perpetual term under this model, and Wiley grants perpetual one-copy, one-user licenses to academic and public libraries alike. Id. ¶¶ 130-132. Hachette and Penguin limit their one-copy, one-user licenses for public libraries to one- or two-year terms, during which there is no limit on the number of times an ebook can be read and after which a library must purchase a new license. Id. ¶¶ 134, 147. HarperCollins uses a “26-Circ Model,” which allows libraries to circulate an ebook twenty-six times, over any time period, before the license expires. Id. ¶¶ 135-140. HarperCollins and Penguin also use a Pay-Per-Use model -- a onetime circulation to a single patron at a significantly reduced fee -- and Wiley has experimented with various subscription models. Id. ¶¶ 141-146, 155, 191. The Publishers’ library expert testified, and IA does not dispute, that this “thriving ebook licensing market for libraries” has “increased in recent years” and “is predicated on licensing revenues that are paid by libraries to entities like OverDrive.” Id. ¶ 168. For example, library ebook licenses generate around $59 million per year for Penguin. Id. ¶ 170. Between 2015 and 2020, HarperCollins earned $46.91 million from the American library ebook market. Id. ¶ 172.\n\nIA offers readers a different way to read ebooks online for free. Over the past decade, IA has scanned millions of print books and made the resulting ebooks publicly available on its archive.org and openlibrary.org websites (together, the “Website”). Id. ¶¶ 7, 236; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 12. IA’s basic modus operandi is to acquire print books directly or indirectly, digitally scan them, and distribute the digital copies while retaining the print copies in storage. The Open Library of Richmond (the “Open Library”), another non-profit organization run by Brewster Kahle, buys or accepts donations of print books, primarily from Better World Books (“BWB”), a for-profit used bookstore affiliated with IA and the Open Library. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 313-314, 317, 322, 338. The Open Library then sends the books to IA scanning centers, where operators turn and photograph each page using a book-digitization device called a “Scribe.” Id. ¶¶ 281-283. After scanning, the print books are stored in doublestacked shipping containers and are not circulated. Id. ¶¶ 310- 312; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 23.\n\nIA’s Website includes millions of public domain ebooks that users can download for free and read without restrictions. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 158, 160. Relevant to this action, however, the Website also includes 3.6 million books protected by valid copyrights, including 33,000 of the Publishers’ titles and all of the Works in Suit. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 14, 240; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 160. The Publishers did not authorize IA to create digital copies of the Works in Suit or to distribute those unauthorized ebook editions on IA’s Website. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 243.\n\nIA does not make its ebook copies of copyright-protected works available for mass download. Instead, it professes to perform the traditional function of a library by lending only limited numbers of these works at a time through “Controlled Digital Lending,” or “CDL.” Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 11. CDL’s central tenet, according to a September 2018 Statement and White Paper by a group of librarians, is that an entity that owns a physical book can scan that book and “circulate [the] digitized title in place of [the] physical one in a controlled manner.” Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 436. CDL’s most critical component is a one-to-one “owned to loaned ratio.” Id. Thus, a library or organization that practices CDL will seek to “only loan simultaneously the number of copies that it has legitimately acquired.” Id. “For example, if a library owns three copies of a title and digitizes one copy, it may use CDL to circulate one digital copy and two print, or three digital copies, or two digital copies and one print; in all cases, it could only circulate the same number of copies that it owned before digitization.” Id. According to IA, CDL is especially helpful for patrons who live far from a brick-andmortar library, patrons seeking a book not available from their local library, patrons with disabilities that make it difficult to hold or read print books, and patrons who want brief or spontaneous access to books and for whom it would not be worth a trip to a brick-and-mortar library. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 55-56. \n\nUnder IA’s implementation of CDL, two factors determine the number of digital copies of a book that can be borrowed at any time from IA’s Website. Id. ¶ 50. First, IA makes available one digital copy for each non-circulating print book it keeps in storage. Id. ¶ 51. Second, IA partners with libraries to “contribute” the number of their print copies of the book toward the number of lendable copies on IA’s Website. Id. ¶ 52. Even if a partner library has multiple copies of a book, IA counts only one additional copy per library. Id. For example, if IA owns one non-circulating print copy of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie (1932), and three partner libraries each contribute a copy of the book, IA would lend its digital copy of Little House on the Prairie to up to four patrons at a time. Id. ¶ 53.2\n\nAround 2018, IA began expanding significantly its lending capacity of copyright-protected works through the “Open Libraries” project. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 355. Libraries now can “pool[] their physical collections” with IA “in order to make more lendable copies of digital books available to their users and the world.” Id. ¶ 363. To participate, a Partner Library sends its catalogue to IA to run an “overlap analysis” that compares ISBN numbers for the Partner Library’s physical holdings with IA’s digital holdings. Id. ¶ 365. Whenever a book in the Partner Library’s catalogue matches an ebook on IA’s Website, IA increases by one the number of concurrent checkouts of that book allowed on the Website. Id. ¶ 367. As of late 2021, 62 Partner Libraries, including 13 public libraries, had contributed books through IA’s overlap analysis. Id. ¶ 392. IA encourages Partner Libraries to populate their websites with links to IA’s Website. Id. ¶¶ 393-396. \n\nAnyone can become a patron of IA, and borrow up to ten ebooks at a time for up to fourteen days each, by submitting a valid email address. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 25-26. IA never charges patrons fees for any service, including borrowing books. Id. ¶ 25. The Website has titles in popular categories, including Romance, Thrillers, “Books we Love,” and “Trending Books.” Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 514-516. Patrons can read books they have checked out on IA’s BookReader web browser platform, or they can download a “High Quality” encrypted PDF or ePub version of the ebook.3 Id. ¶¶ 207-209, 277; Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 32, 34. IA secures its downloadable versions with software that prevents the patron from copying, accessing, or distributing the book after the loan period. Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 34. The BookReader application also has a “Read Aloud” feature that converts the text to audio and plays it aloud. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 276. After a book is checked out, a “Purchase at Better World Books” button appears at the top of the browser window. Id. ¶ 346. This button links to BWB’s website, where patrons can buy a used print copy of the book. Id. ¶ 347. BWB pays IA whenever someone buys a book after using the “Purchase at Better World Books” link. Id. IA’s Website also includes a link to “Donate” to IA. Id. ¶ 348.\n\nIn March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic closed libraries nationwide and, by IA’s estimation, took 650 million print books out of circulation. Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 70. Judging itself “uniquely positioned to be able to address this problem quickly and efficiently,” on March 24, 2020, IA launched what it called the National Emergency Library (“NEL”), intending it to “run through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.” Id. ¶¶ 72, 74. During the NEL, IA lifted the technical controls enforcing its one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio and allowed up to ten thousand patrons at a time to borrow each ebook on the Website. Pl.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 542-543, 547. IA ended the NEL on June 16, 2020, shortly after this action was filed, and returned to its “traditional controlled digital lending,” which remains in effect. Id. ¶ 571; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 96.\n\nIn the two years after the NEL, IA’s user base increased from 2.6 million to about 6 million. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 248, 250. As of 2022, IA hosts about 70,000 daily ebook “borrows.” Id. ¶ 249."}, {"id": 6464, "actor": "SEO & Content Marketing", "prompt": "I want you to help me write an article about \"CS: hia home owners warranty insurance \" in NSW.

Today, I need you to teach Longitudinal and Lateral-Directional Stability in aircrafts. I shall be providing you slide by slide content and you shall begin your tutoring accordingly. The syllabus for the upcoming test is lectures 10-15. The content of the 10th lecture is as follows:\n```\nSlide 1:\nLongitudinal Static Stability\nRecall that the eigenvalues of the short period (SP) dynamics are given by\n$$\n\\lambda^2-M\\_q \\lambda-M\\_\\alpha=0\n$$\nHorizontal tail and the wing \"stabilize\" $M\\_q$\nHT \"stabilizes\" $M\\_\\alpha$, but the wing does not necessarily do as much\nToday's class: a closer look at $M\\_\\alpha$\n- Static stability and $M\\_\\alpha$\n- Stability metric: static margin\n- Stick-free and stick-fixed static stability\n\nSlide 2:\nReview of Stability\nSo far: an aircraft is stable if it rejects a disturbance; i.e., the aircraft\nreturns to the intended equilibrium as t goes to 1\nA di↵erent perspective on stability: when the aircraft is disturbed from\nthe equilibrium, do the forces and moments instantaneously try to restore\nthe equilibrium?\nStrictly speaking, the initial response\nType of disturbance: perturbation in the position of the aircraft\nAnalogy motivated by the classic example of a ball and a\ncurved surface\n\nSlide 3:\n- Formal definition: a system is statically stable if, upon a disturbance $\\Delta x$, the force $F$ produced by the system is such that $F \\cdot \\Delta x<0$\n- This is considered to be a necessary condition for stability (in the sense of asymptotic convergence to equilibrium)\nExample (spring-mass system): let $\\ddot{x}=F=-k x$, where $k>0$\n- Clearly, $x \\cdot F=-k x^2<0$. Hence, the system is statically stable\n- Eigenvalues: $\\lambda= \\pm i \\sqrt{k} \\Longrightarrow$ the system is marginally stable\n\nSlide 4:\nExample (spring-mass system): let ̈x = F = 2 ̇x - x, with the initial\n\ncondition x(0) = 0.1, x ̇(0) = 0\nThe initial force F(0) =\n\nx(0), and x(0) · F(x(0)) < 0.\n\nThe system is statically stable\nEigenvalues:\n\n\\lambda = 1 the system is unstable\n\nThus, static stability is not a sufficient condition for stability\nStatic stability is determined only by the stiffness of the system\nWhy bother about static stability?\n-Historical evolution of ideas\n-Design parameters\n\nSlide 5:\nFramework for Longitudinal Static Stability\n\nSet lateral-directional variables to zero\nAssume \\alpha is small\nAnalysis for the wing, followed by wing + HT\n\nSlide 6:\nSingle Wing: Trim\n- Suppose the wing $A C$ is at a distance $x\\_{A C}$ from the CG of the aircraft. We first determine the trim $\\alpha$ by setting $M^0=0$ (about the CG)\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\left(c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}+x\\_{A C}\\left(C\\_{L\\_0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)\\right)=0 \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow \\quad & \\alpha^0=-\\frac{c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}+x\\_{A C} C\\_{L\\_0}}{x\\_{A C} C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTrimmed value of lift (with $C\\_{m\\_{A C}}<0$ )\n$$\nL^0=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\left(-\\frac{c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}}{x\\_{A C}}\\right) \\begin{cases}>0, & x\\_{A C}>0 \\\\ <0, & x\\_{A C}<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSlide 7:\nSuppose the AoA is perturbed by $\\Delta \\alpha$ (small). The instantaneous pitching moment is given by\n$$\n\\Delta M=x\\_{A C} L\\_\\alpha \\Delta \\alpha\n$$\nStatic stability: need $\\Delta \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta M<0$, i.e., $x\\_{A C}<0$\nCondition for static stability of a wing: wing must be behind the CG\nBut we need $x\\_{A C}>0$ for positive lift!\nTwo ways to tackle this problem:\n- Use a flap and active control\n- Use a horizontal tail\n\nSlide 8: Trimming with a Horizontal Tail\nLet $\\alpha^0$ be the trim angle of attack of the aircraft. We will assume that:\nThe wing inclination angle $i\\_w=0$ and the tail is symmetric\nThe tail incidence angle $i\\_t$ can be varied as a control input\nThe effect of downwash is negligible\nThe lift on the tail is given by\n$$\nL\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha+i\\_t\\right)\n$$\nNote: if the tail has an elevator instead of variable $i\\_t$ as the control input, then\n$$\nL\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t\\left(C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha+i\\_t\\right)+C\\_{L\\_{\\delta e}} \\delta\\_e\\right)\n$$\n\nSlide 9:\nAt trim, $M=M^{\\text {wing }}+M^{\\text {tail }}=0$ about the $C G$; i.e.,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& M^{\\text {wing }}+L^{\\text {wing }} x\\_{A C}=I\\_t L^{\\text {tail }} \\\\\n\\text { Thus, } & x\\_{A C}\\left(C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)+c C\\_{m a c}=\\frac{I\\_t S\\_t}{S} C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha^0+i\\_t\\right) \\\\\n\\text { i.e., } \\quad & \\frac{x\\_{A C}}{c}\\left(C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)+C\\_{m a c}=V\\_H C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha^0+i\\_t\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe trim $A \\circ A$ is given by\n$$\n\\alpha^0=\\frac{1}{\\left(V\\_H-x\\_{A C} / c\\right) C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}}\\left(\\left(x\\_{a c} / c\\right) C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{m a c}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{V\\_H}{V\\_H-x\\_{A C} / c}\\right) i\\_t\n$$\nUsually, $V\\_H>x\\_{A C} / c$. Therefore, as $i\\_t$ increases (i.e., deflects downwards), the trim $\\alpha^0$ reduces, and vice-versa.\nTherefore, the tail-based control surface allows the aircraft to trim across a wide range of values of lift (and flight speeds). The same principle applies to elevator-based control.\n\nSlide 10: Static Stability\nSuppose that the angle of attack is perturbed by a small $\\Delta \\alpha$. Then,\nChange in lift on the wing: $\\Delta L^w=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha$\nChange in lift on HT: $\\Delta L^t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha$\nNet change in pitching moment\n$$\n\\Delta M=\\Delta L^w x\\_{A C}-\\Delta L^t I\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S c C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha\\left(\\frac{x\\_{A C}}{c}-V\\_H\\right)\n$$\nNeed $\\Delta \\alpha \\times \\Delta M<0$ for static stability\nAircraft is longitudinally statically stable only if $V\\_H>\\frac{X\\_{A C}}{c}$\n\nSlide 11: Interpreting the Static Stability Condition\nStatic stability condition: $V\\_H>X\\_{A C} / C$\nThe critical location of the $C G$ at which $c V\\_H=x\\_{A C}$ is called the neutral point (NP)\n- CG ahead of NP: statically stable\n- CG behind NP: statically unstable\nIf the whole aircraft were viewed as a single wing, then the NP corresponds the location of the $A C$ of the complete aircraft\nWe define the static margin:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SM}=\\frac{x\\_{N P}-x\\_{A C}}{c}\n$$\nAn aircraft is loaded on the ground with payload and fuel so that the static margin never decreases below a threshold\n```\n\nNow get started with your tutoring for lecture 10"}, {"id": 6491, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Rank the Spider-Man films according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores.

Each row is comma-separated, with the first row being the header row and the following rows containing data.\n\nThe `start_row` parameter specifies the row number from which the parsing should start.
