Given material: Is the spotlight fading on Ed Miliband’s leadership? Labour appears to have sleepwalked into a leadership crisis. But how likely are claims of a new leader to replace him before the 2015 general election? And who might replace him? Is Ed Miliband on borrowed time? Can he survive the weekend? Until Christmas? Until next year’s election? In the last 72 hours Labour has been plunged into panic with talk of poisonous briefings and even claims that a letter is circulating calling for Mr Miliband to stand aside. But why now? What exactly is troubling the party that was not doing so six months ago? And is there anything in any of this beyond feverish speculation? Well, yes and no. First, the speculation. As of yet no such “letter” has been seen. No MP has come out on the record in favour of ousting their leader. Nor are any of the recent criticisms of his leadership particularly new. Mr Miliband has long suffered an image problem. There have been flashes of policy inspiration, but he has struggled to broaden his appeal beyond core Labour voters. Some say the cost-of-living-crisis is not permeating with quite the policy punch he would hope. What has changed for Mr Miliband recently is the acuteness of his problems. Consider the above against the more pressing backdrop of a collapse in his personal poll ratings, the rise of the SNP threatening to scorch 20 of Labour’s 41 Scottish seats (crucial for a 2015 victory). Add the Greens garnering greater support – not to mention Ukip broadening its appeal among the working class. Suddenly the picture changes. Problems that were once platitudes now have a crushing urgency to be resolved. Indeed, by this analysis Labour is not just drifting. It is failing to pre-empt contemporary political threats – and, thanks to new, credible alternatives, heading to the humiliation of defeat where victory once seemed likely. That is a particularly rude awakening for MPs, many of whom feel the downward trajectory is difficult to curtail at this late stage. Add that to the New Statesman magazine appearing to withdraw its once-default support for Mr Miliband, and it soon becomes clear why the mood inside Labour HQ has plummeted. But could this really result in a change of leader before the election? The prospect is not impossible but it is still difficult to imagine. Firstly, Labour’s historical record in ousting a leader is nothing short of abysmal. Party rules mean that a vote of no-confidence can only be marshalled during the party’s annual conference – which was six weeks ago. For the moment, curmudgeonly backbenchers seem happier complaining off-the-record about their leader than putting their head above the parapet and pitching an alternative. And that’s hardly surprising. Labour’s MP’s are not known to be forward about coming forward. One only need remember 2009 during Gordon Brown’s premiership which saw former pensions secretary James Purnell’s dramatic resignation, in which he called for the then prime minister to stand aside “to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election”. It was followed in 2010 by simultaneous resignations by Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon. But neither of these were enough to move Mr Brown, who went on to lose the election himself five months later. Mr Miliband appears just as resilient. The prospect of him grabbing his coat and exiting stage left is unlikely. Three MPs are understood to have told Dave Watts, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party that Mr Miliband should stand down. But it will need far more than that – as well as a clear contingency plan – for any chance of a leadership shift. Finally, the perennial question that hampers any immediate prospect of change. Who exactly would replace him? Who could actually do a better job? And who could stave off the prospect of a party implosion that would almost inevitably follow? With no clear contender to challenge Mr Miliband, talk of a change of leader remains just that. Here are five potential successors. The shadow health secretary is currently the leading candidate. His performances at the last Labour conference were impressive, where Mr Miliband’s were not. His dogged campaigning on the Hillsborough tragedy has won admiration across parliament. His working class roots are of contrast to Mr Miliband who the New Statesman described as an “old-style Hampstead socialist”. One of the more accomplished performers, who has been impressive head-to-head against Home Secretary Theresa May. The shadow home secretary would have the support of her husband, Ed Balls. But that could also be to her detriment. Many believe Balls is too closely linked to the Brown and Miliband era. He is already tipped as a future Labour leader but an elevation to the top post may seem premature for the 36-year-old. Instead the shadow business secretary called on the party to focus on “communities, rather than the distracting nonsense by some in the Westminster bubble”. The shadow welfare secretary has had a meteoric rise entering the shadow cabinet 18 months after election despite being described by the editor of BBC Newsnight as “boring snoring”. A former UK junior chess champion and Bank of England economist is among a number of Labour MPs who have been tipped for leadership positions but whose time may not be yet. She wrote on Twitter: “A Labour government will make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people. But we’ll only get one if we stay united behind Ed Miliband”. The former postman who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, appears to value his private life and has all but ruled himself out last month when he said he had “no appetite for being on the frontbench” let alone a potential prime minister which he described as a “god-awful job”."]}, {"id": 25127, "title": "Programming & Software Development", "content": ["You are tasked with implementing a control mechanism for a pitch angle.

Our history makes cynicism and refusal to be one big easy target a survival trait handed down from generation to generation. Black people born in America never got to see Black people united like African and Haitians. Division kept our labor cheap, uprisings down and power non-existent.      So this Web3 community push seems lost on the culture, but we were built for this and don't know it yet. Our history is full of us developing our societies within American society specifically for us like Black clubs, Black barbershops, Black beauty salons. Our mothers traded knowledge that kept us fed on shoe string budgets (fried food kept longer) and our leaders were made in secret least they be targeted. Our hood is one big \"Decentralized Autonomous Organization\" with its own economy and justice in spite of America's society.      Our secret societies were demonized, our ways seen as savage, until they were copied and made mainstream. Been that way since the dancing in juke joints was seen as savage and deviant until Elvis, backwards hats was seen as thuggish and ghetto at first, before \"bling\" was in a Zales commercial, it was seen as the reason why Black people stay impoverished and Lil Wayne complained about it in a song. I'm old enough to remember when rap was evil and the cause of the crack epidemic. Eminem is compared to Elvis for a reason.  The Cool Factor  This leads me to Black Twitter, you see in 2009, Twitter was barely getting celebrities to buy into it. 3rd party apps were allowed to keep developers as users. Then Black people like me used the open space to promote our podcasts, developed fans and networked as a community. We did things like fake RT, set a community standard that after midnight explicit tweets were allowed and our network grew. Mobile app developers created an entire market around it.      Live tweets? We used to call it \"watching a show as a family\". Our reaction to Game of Throne's Red Wedding episode, my favorite Black Twitter event ever, made that show a global phenomenon. My Game of Thrones shirt that I wore to a beach party got a lot of attention from female book fans that saw their fandom get a credibility boost. The ladies I attended the party had to pull me away and later joked that \"Pam\" was two drinks away from asking to see my dragon. By the season finale of the show, the author had to write a new book for the new audience and HBO's spinoff is on it's 3rd episode as I type this.      Black Twitter: Influence goes Global      Black Twitter made Empire, Blackish, Scandal and Black Jesus ratings juggernauts. Marvel's Civil War movie saw Black Twitter choose sides with hashtags and #TeamCap claiming victory. #TeamCap also claims credit for the scene with Black Panther and Captain America in Avengers: Endgame. HBO's Insecure's star used to be the Insecure Black Girl account on Black Twitter. Quinta Brunson also went from the TL to her own sitcom. Black Panther became a such a global phenomenon that Marvel's rival DC still hasn't recovered. Captain America's portal scene with Black Panther in Endgame was their thanks to the culture for some. DC looked so uncool and white that Batman roast sessions were common on Twitter.     Black Lives Matter sentiment hit Batman who was seen as an overzealous cop and a privileged rich white kid they couldn't relate to instead of the caped crusader who targeted anonymous thugs and supervillains. Black Twitter's roast sessions were acknowledged in a Batman movie, DC's best PR move.    Black Twitter: Unpaid Innovators      Now imagine all of our creativity that made networks rich being harnessed and sold as a community with payment automatically distributed according to contribution and each transaction down to the penny being publicly available. Rap labels without the embezzlement or bad contracts, equal pay for men and women, no Black leaders or religion, and a win for one is a win for all. My viral video just gave the community more promotion and more eyes for your music label who's album cover was part of an NFT collection that is more valuable now for all the token holders.      Class is video and audio based with 5 minutes being seen as too long.

Instead, designers have given us options. And there are a few lessons to be learnt in how to wear these ruffles well. On paper, pink and ruffles should have been too sickly sweet to make the cut. But in reality A Détacher's designer Monika Kowalska has managed to make a very modern, simple dress. Tick. Karl's turned the pretty dial up to eleven with this lacy number. Black boots and tights keeps the dress from being too bridal. Who would have thought it, pure girly frills in lilac and peach are literally the best combination. Like Karl, black accessories keep it from getting too Sandra Dee. Silky flamenco ruffles, cut out shoulders and a skirt slashed to the thigh banishes any feeling that frills mean frump. The Rodarte sisters have a particular brand of 'gothic romanticism' that walks the perfect line between gritty and girly. Case in point, their leather frilly jacket. Grey jersey is given new life with a smattering of frills at Stella. But if you try it at home, this much fabric calls for a pointed heel. The 1980s were arguably the glory days for the ruffle. Valentino's 'ra-ra skirt' dress gives a nice little nod to the decade but thankfully there are no leg warmers in sight.

The basic unit of communication will no longer be typed out in e-mails. It will be shot in pictures and shown on video. Companies have already discovered that the written word is failing them. Its feebleness compared with the moving image was rammed home in 2010 when the sight of BP's oil spewing out into the Gulf of Mexico on YouTube sent a message to the world far more compelling than any written statement could ever be. If the word has become weak at conveying big corporate messages, it has become even weaker at conveying small ones. For years the in-boxes of all office workers have been overflowing with unread e-mails. But managers will do something about it and desist from communicating with staff in this way. E-mail will still exist as a way of talking to one person at a time, but as a means of mass communication it will be finished. Companies will find instead that to get a message over to employees, customers, shareholders and the outside world, video is far more effective. In the past three years video has come from nothing to make up nearly half of internet traffic; in another three, it is likely to be more than three-quarters. So far corporations have taken a back seat in this growth, but they will soon need to climb into the front and start to drive it. This shift in communications will have three important effects. It will change the sort of person who makes it to the corner office. It will alter the way that businesses are managed. And it will shift the position corporations occupy in society and possibly make us like some of them just a little bit more. The new corporate leaders will no longer be pen pushers and bean counters. The 20-year reign of faceless bosses will come to an end. Charisma will be back in: all successful business chiefs will have to be storytellers and performers. Just as political leaders have long had to be dynamite on TV to stand much hope of election or survival, so too will corporate leaders. They must be able to sell not only their vision of their companies but their vision of themselves. The new big boss will be expected to set an example; any leaders showing signs of human frailty will be out on their ears. The moral majority will tighten its hold on corporate life, first in America, but then elsewhere too. With this shift will come a change in management style. Numbers and facts will be supplanted by appeals to emotion to make employees and customers do what they are told. The businessperson's emotion may be no more genuine than the politician's, but successful bosses will get good at faking it. Others will struggle: prepare to cringe in as corporate leaders spout a lot of phoney stuff that used to look bad enough when written down, but will sound even worse spoken. One good consequence of the change, however, will be a greater clarity in the way companies think about their businesses. The written word was a forgiving medium for over-complicated, ill-conceived messages. Video demands simplicity. The best companies will use this to their advantage by thinking through more rigorously what it is they are trying to say and do.", "B: Large corporations are already using video extensively."]}, {"id": 25490, "title": "Job Application & Customer Management", "content": ["Can you help me figure out how to ask my boss for a raise based on my skills and time at the company?"]}, {"id": 25491, "title": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "content": ["What are the bases to consider when determining if the online journal Web sites are reliable?"]}, {"id": 25492, "title": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "content": ["What does the fox say?"]}, {"id": 25493, "title": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "content": ["Context: At school today John was not present.

breakdown of everything this book has to offer  we're going to go over flow states the top 10 brave foods to supercharge your  brain the four modern day villains that are  holding you back how to find your laser focus the eight intelligences  unlocking your memory and heaps more let's jump into it  alright so i'm super excited to be breaking down this book today  this was by far one of my favorite books i've read this year mainly because i found this book to be super practical  and it seemed more like a practical guide than just a heap of  uh information about self-help  at the end of each section there were plenty of practice exercises that you  could implement into your life straight away  so the book is broken down into four main parts  freeing your mind mindset motivation and methods so what is mindset  the deeply held beliefs attitudes and assumptions we create about who we are  how the world works and what we are  capable of and deserve and what is possible this anecdote comes a little bit later in the book but i found it  a useful example so i'd like to share it here first  he gives an example of a young elephant that is chained to a stake in the ground  and as the elephant grows into a fully mature elephant  its mind has placed limitations on itself  although it could easily rip the small flimsy stake out of the ground   to be free  it has developed this learned helplessness so it doesn't even try  and the book goes into this concept of unlimiting which is the act or process of casting aside inaccurate  and restrictive perceptions and embracing the reality that with the  right mindset motivation and   methods there are no limitations  so the book is broken down into these sections accordingly  mindset motivation and methods and this is the core philosophy of the book  modern day supervillains the 4ds these are the modern day villains that  15 years ago we weren't even dealing with  so let me introduce the four villains and then i'll give you some of the remedies that the author suggests for each one  the first of the d's is digital deluge compared to the 15th century we now  consume as much data in a single day as an average person from the 1400s would  have absorbed in their entire lifetime so that is  amazing and we are being bombarded with data  we're always switched on we're always hooked up to the net  humans today are consuming three times more than our parents in the 1960s  there's just too much information too much neural activity going on and all of that extra activity can have ill effects on our brains  it can lead to things like brain fog subpar memory and fatigue  chances are that you guys have probably felt that body fatigue after a long  period  in front of a screen the second d is digital distraction so  we live here now and because of our always-on  ever-connected devices we're struggling to find connection when we're with  friends and family and we're struggling to stay focused at work  so this is where we live now we're connected to the web in every downtime moment waiting for the bus waiting in a line  um we need to think what happens when this is our constant way of being  when every downtime moment is filled with shining screens and all this extra  stimulus this is leading to less social  interaction with friends and family because our devices make us feel more  secure but actually we're less happy next  digital dementia neuroscientist manfred spitzer uses the term digital dementia  to describe how overuse of digital technology  results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities he argues that short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from  under use if we overuse technology in the past we  needed to remember things like people's phone  numbers street addresses things like this  now millennials obtain all their answers to problems at the click of a mouse  or the swipe of a finger the reliance on technology to solve every question  confuses people's perception of their own knowledge and intelligence  and that reliance may well lead to overconfidence and poor decision making  before the internet we didn't have the immediate and readily available access  to the opinions of others we needed to reflect  reason draw our own conclusions from our own  insights so if technology is doing all the deductions for us they also found that the longer that person had been driving the larger the  hippocampus was in their brain so in short the brain is malleable it's  able to expand and change over time and it  can change its structure to meet its cognitive load  our second brain is the brain in our gut or the ens  the enteric nervous system scientists don't know everything there is to know  about the smaller brain however they are  beginning to understand how it can affect our mood and our behavior  without going into too much detail it is believed that the second brain in our and your physical condition of your body physiology  so you might want to ask yourself how motivated  and energized are you to learn what you have to learn  what are some things you can do to change your state maybe change your  posture  do some stretching some breathing exercises  you can try some of these before you sit down to study  t is for teach if you want to cut your learning curve dramatically  learn with the intention of teaching the information to someone else  e is for enter what is the simplest and most powerful of someone with steel genius would be sergey brin of google  the main concept here is that genius extends beyond academics  so don't limit yourself by negative self-talk like  i'm just not intelligent i always got bad grades at college so therefore i  mustn't even be in the realm of genius  you can be a mixture of different geniuses so have a think about what your  genius is and let it free  overcoming limiting beliefs before we go  over the steps that he advises to overcome limiting beliefs like man i always screw up this sort of thing or  i'm just not a good companion to be around try to counteract that with  something like um just because i haven't always been good at this  in the past doesn't mean that i can't be  great at this now and in the future so  that is step one make sure you get to the source of it and identify it give it  a name step two get to the facts the steak is  small in size i'm a strong fully grown elephant what  is to stop me from ripping that steak right out of the ground if you believe it can grow and then you can put in the work to make it grow  lie number two we only use ten percent of our brains  new belief i am learning to use my whole brain  in the best way possible line number three mistakes are failures  the new belief you want to create is that mistakes are signs that you're  trying something new and they are opportunities to learn life  isn't about comparing yourself to anyone else  it's about comparing yourself to who you were yesterday  there's no such thing as failure only a failure to learn s3 to prevent us from getting overwhelmed and  paralyzed let's go a little bit deeper into purpose  as we establish earlier we don't have to enjoy something to be motivated to do it  however you do need to have a clear purpose for  why you were doing something you can ask yourself  why must i study this or why must i learn this  the book also outlines not to get confused between  passion and purpose your purpose is what you are here on earth for  and maybe it is to help people so the author jim's passion is learning but his values allow him to choose what things to pursue in life  and what things to deny he doesn't mind having  uh fomo which he he calls fomo which is the fear of missing out  especially if that thing that he is being asked to be a part of doesn't  in any way contribute to his values or his uh purpose in life  and he uh he actually had a word uh which i'm currently blank on  uh uh jomo uh jomo he said to encourage you to have  jomo which is the joy of missing out instead of fomo the fear of missing out you know attainable chunks it become it became manageable  flow state okay let's take a  quote from the book i'm sure there have been times when you were  so completely caught up in what you were doing that everything else disappeared  and it just felt like the most natural thing you've ever done  time probably melted away from you during those experiences  people regularly tell me about focusing so deeply on what they are doing  that they had no idea that afternoon had become night  or they had missed multiple meals in the process vision is competing for your brain's finite energy  so a messy desk with many different objects and colors  will make your brain more fatigued than having a tidy clean desk without  any distractions and this is essential that all  all distractions are eliminated because it can take almost  20 minutes to refocus and get back into the flow  if you get kicked out of it by a distraction so  make sure you do whatever you can to eliminate any potential distractions  next allow enough time if you're serious about getting into a flow state at least 90 minutes for whatever i'm focusing on  the final part of this book is part three which is methods the how  when the billionaire investor warren buffett was asked what factor do you  feel has been the most important in getting to where you've gotten in life  buffered immediately replied focus and bill gates who is sitting next to him  agreed steve jobs has also harped on the importance of focus  for steve jobs focus was the ability to say no to almost everything  and carefully choose what to spend his precious time on the breathing techniques also fail the only thing you can do next is to  confront that stress uh confront that thing that is causing  you stress and lastly schedule time in your  calendar for whatever is distracting you or giving you distress  okay moving on study why are most of us restrained in our  ability ability to study most people do not know how to study of  effectively because they were never taught  many people naturally assume they already know how to learn  the challenge is that most of the techniques that we use now impact on your success be aware of your posture  if you're slumped over this can stifle your breathing  and it will make you prematurely tired so you want to sit up straight improve  your posture and see if you can feel or see if you  can change that state  the sixth habit is to listen with your whole brain  so you want to get better at listening and actually listening  to someone when they're speaking not just waiting to reply to the person  so you want to hold yourself actively listen  don't think about your to-do list or what you're going to watch on netflix if you're trying to remember someone's someone's name when you first hear it  you want to try and link it to a visual image so  if their last name is baker then you might want to imagine  a baker with a big white hat next is to link words via association  so try to link new information to old information  if you can associate the new information with something that you're  already familiar with it will greatly improve your memory  so what comes to your mind when you think of a cherry perhaps red suddenly it starts raining batteries and berries  the balloons pop and the berries splatter all over the ground  so we could continue in that fashion but i think you get the idea  you could break down each line of the periodic table into a short story  or you could break down each list that you have into  a short story and that will greatly help  you to memorize the information  okay so let's move down here to speed reading  now he dedicates quite a few pages to speed reading in the book  but for the purpose of this summary i'll so this is where you make sure that you've addressed everything  on the agenda and within this mental model  i think this is a great exercise to do if you're in  if you're by yourself or in a team and the reason why i think this is a great  mental model is because what most people do is they view  problems from their own perspective that that one perspective and what i  think this method allows you to do is view the problem from multiple  different perspectives the eight intelligences  why is it important for us to have tools to help us think in different ways nearly 100 years now so a visual learner is someone who  prefers to learn through pictures videos and  charts an auditory learner is someone who prefers to learn through listening  and a kinesthetic learner is someone who prefers to have some kind of physical  interaction or hands-on approach  if you guys are interested in finding out what type of learner you are  go ahead grab a copy of this book as it gives you a quiz  that helps you find which learning style you are  for myself i was a visual learner ordered thinking and consequences so let's say you decide that you're  going to buy a subscription to netflix because  everyone's using netflix and it's a cool thing to do so why not  so this is where most people's thinking resides  in the first order most people don't even get to that second order of  thinking  but let's uh let's ask ourselves and then what  well you're going to need to get your money's worth right  so the average netflix subscriber watches around one hour of netflix per all right so that brings us to the end of this summary guys we covered  freeing your mind mindset  motivation and the methods to becoming limitless  so i hope you guys enjoyed this summary i really enjoyed  putting it together if you did get some value out of this video please like  comment and subscribe to the channel because it really does help guys thank  you and if you would like me to summarize a  book that you're interested in please don't hesitate just drop it in  the comments below thank you so much\""]}, {"id": 25504,

Such expressions are known as measures of dispersion since they indicate how values are dispersed throughout a population. The variance is the average or mean of the squares of the distance each data point in a set is from the mean of all the data points in the set. Mathematically, variance is represented as σ2, according to the equation: σ2 = [(x1-μ)2 + (x2-μ)2 + (x3-μ)2 +...(xn-μ)2]/n; where x1,2,3,.....n are the values of specific variables; μ is the mean, or average, of all the values; and n is the total number of values. Variance is commonly replaced in applications by its square root, which is known as the standard deviation or σ.", "Variance is one of several measures of dispersion which are used to evaluate the spread of a distribution of numbers. Such measures are important because they provide ways of obtaining information about data sets without considering all of the elements of the data individually.", "To understand variance, one must first understand something about other measures of dispersion. One measure of dispersion is the \"average of deviations.\" This value is equal to the average, for a set of numbers, of the differences between each number and the set's mean. The mean (also known as the average) is simply the sum of the numbers in a given set divided by the number of entries in the set. For the set of eight test scores: 7 + 25 + 36 + 44 + 59 + 71 + 85 + 97, the mean is 53. The deviation from the mean for any given value is that value minus the value of the mean. For example, the first number in the set, 7, has a deviation from the mean of -46; the second number, 25, has a deviation from the mean of -28; and so on. However, the sum of these deviations across the entire data set will be equal to 0 (since by definition the mean is the \"middle\" value with all other values being above or below it.) A measure that will show how much deviation is involved without having these deviations add up to zero would be more useful in evaluating data. Such a nonzero sum can be obtained by adding the absolute values of the deviations. This average is the absolute mean deviation. However, for reasons that will not be dealt with here, even this expression has limited application.", "Theoretically, the value of σ2 should relate valuable information regarding the spread of data. However, in order for this concept to be applied in practical situations (we cannot talk about squared test scores) we may elect to use the square root of the variance. This value is called the standard deviation of the scores. For this series of test scores the standard deviation is the square root of 825.38 or 28.73. In general, a small standard deviation indicates that the data are clustered closely around the mean; a large standard deviation shows that the data are more spread apart.", "While modern computerization reduces the need for laborious statistical calculations, it is still necessary to understand and interpret the concept of variance and its daughter, standard deviation, in order to digest the statistical significance of data.

Can you decipher them and put them in the correct order? Additionally, include a scatter plot that visually represents the correlation between your issues and the progression of the project. But wait, the plot is missing some data points. Can you use your statistical skills to fill in the blanks? Lastly, insert an image that represents the major milestone(s) of your project. However, the image is pixelated and distorted. Can you use your image editing skills to restore it to its original state?

That court denied petitioner's motions to change venue to Hill County, where petitioner claimed to have its principal place of business in Montana.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that Montana's venue rules—which permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against a corporation, like petitioner, that is incorporated elsewhere—do not work a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.", "Held:  The distinction in treatment contained in Montana's venue rules does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.  Those rules neither deprive petitioner of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion, and are valid because they can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest:  adjustment of the disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial.  Montana could reasonably determine that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating in the county of its home office outweighs a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice. Petitioner has not shown that the Montana venue rules' hinging on State of incorporation rather than domicile makes them so under- or overinclusive as to be irrational.  Besides, petitioner, being domiciled outside Montana, would not benefit from a rule turning on domicile, and therefore cannot complain of a rule hinging on State of incorporation.

We hold that it does not.", "2", "Respondents William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson were employed by petitioner Burlington Northern Railroad Company, a corporation owing its existence to the laws of Delaware and having a principal place of business in Fort Worth, Texas.  Ford and Johnson raised a claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51-60, and brought suit in the state trial court for Yellowstone County, Montana, alleging injuries sustained while working at Burlington's premises in Sheridan, Wyoming.  In each case, Burlington moved to change venue to Hill County, Montana, where it claimed to have its principal place of business in that State.  The trial court denied each motion, and Burlington brought interlocutory appeals.", "3", "The Supreme Court of Montana consolidated the two cases and affirmed the decisions of the trial court.  --- Mont. ----, 819 P.2d 169 (1991).  Under the Montana venue rules, the court said, a foreign corporation may be sued in any of Montana's counties. Id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 171.  The court rejected Burlington's argument that the State's venue rules worked a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The Montana venue rules, the court explained, were subject merely to rational-basis review, id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 173, which was satisfied, at least in these cases, by the consonance of the rules with federal policy, embodied in FELA, of facilitating recovery by injured railroad workers, id., at ---- - ----, 819 P.2d, at 173-174.  Besides, the court said, Montana's venue rules did not even discriminate against Burlington, since Ford and Johnson could have sued the corporation in the Federal District Court for Montana, which sits in Yellowstone County, among other places. Id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 175.  We granted certiorari, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 964, 117 L.Ed.2d 130 (1992), and, although our reasoning differs from that of the State Supreme Court, now affirm.*", "4", "A Montana statute provides that \"the proper place of trial for all civil actions is the county in which the defendants or any of them may reside at the commencement of the action.\"  Mont.Code Ann. § 25-2-118(1) (1991).  But, \"if none of the defendants reside in the state, the proper place of trial is any county the plaintiff designates in the complaint.\"  § 25-2-118(2).  The Supreme Court of Montana has long held that a corporation does not \"reside in the state\" for venue purposes unless Montana is its State of incorporation, see, e.g., Haug v. Burlington Northern R. Co., 236 Mont. 368, 371, 770 P.2d 517, 519 (1989);  Foley v. General Motors Corp., 159 Mont. 469, 472-473, 499 P.2d 774, 776 (1972);  Hanlon v. Great Northern R. Co., 83 Mont. 15, 21, 268 P. 547, 549 (1928);  Pue v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 78 Mont. 40, 43, 252 P. 313, 315 (1926), and that a Montana corporation resides in the Montana county in which it has its principal place of business, see, e.g., Mapston v. Joint School District No. 8, 227 Mont. 521, 523, 740 P.2d 676, 677 (1987);  Platt v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P.2d 336, 338 (1986).  In combination, these venue rules, with exceptions not here relevant, permit a plaintiff to sue a domestic company in just the one county where it has its principal place of business, while a plaintiff may sue a foreign corporation in any of the State's 56 counties.  Burlington claims the distinction offends the Equal Protection Clause.", "5", "The Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1.  Because the Montana venue rules neither deprive Burlington of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion, they do not deny equal protection to Burlington unless they fail in rationally furthering legitimate state ends.  See, e.g., United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 64, 110 S.Ct. 387, 396, 107 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989); Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989).", "6", "Venue rules generally reflect equity or expediency in resolving disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial.  See, e.g., Citizens & Southern National Bank v. Bougas, 434 U.S. 35, 44, n. 10, 98 S.Ct. 88, 94, n. 10, 54 L.Ed.2d 218 (1977);  Denver & R.G.W.R. Co. v. Trainmen, 387 U.S. 556, 560, 87 S.Ct. 1746, 1748, 18 L.Ed.2d 954 (1967);  Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 623, 84 S.Ct. 805, 812, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964);  F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure 47 (3d ed. 1985).  The forum preferable to one party may be undesirable to another, and the adjustment of such warring interests is a valid state concern. Cf. United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 178, 101 S.Ct. 453, 461, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980).  In striking the balance between them, a State may have a number of choices, any of which would survive scrutiny, each of them passable under the standard tolerating some play in the joints of governmental machinery.  See Bain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson, 282 U.S. 499, 501, 51 S.Ct. 228, 229, 75 L.Ed. 482 (1931).  Thus, we have no doubt that a State would act within its constitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weight to the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in the counties of their choice under all circumstances.  It is equally clear that a State might temper such an \"any county\" rule to the extent a reasonable assessment of defendants' interests so justified.", "7", "Here, Montana has decided that the any-county rule should give way to a single-county rule where a defendant resides in Montana, arguably on the reasonable ground that a defendant should not be subjected to a plaintiff's tactical advantage of forcing a trial far from the defendant's residence.  At the same time, Montana has weighed the interest of a defendant who does not reside in Montana differently, arguably on the equally reasonable ground that for most nonresident defendants the inconvenience will be great whether they have to defend in, say, Billings or Havre. See Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U.S. 490, 498, 47 S.Ct. 678, 681, 71 L.Ed. 1165 (1927) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Montana could thus have decided that a nonresident defendant's interest in convenience is too slight to outweigh the plaintiff's interest in suing in the forum of his choice.", "8", "Burlington does not, indeed, seriously contend that such a decision is constitutionally flawed as applied to individual nonresident defendants.  Nor does it argue that such a rule is unconstitutional even when applied to corporate defendants without a fixed place of business in Montana.  Burlington does claim, however, that the rule is unconstitutional as applied to a corporate defendant like Burlington that not only has its home office in some other State or country, but also has a place of business in Montana that would qualify as its \"principal place of business\" if it were a Montana corporation.", "9", "Burlington's claim fails.  Montana could reasonably have determined that a corporate defendant's home office is generally of greater significance to the corporation's convenience in litigation than its other offices;  that foreign corporations are unlikely to have their principal offices in Montana;  and that Montana's domestic corporations will probably keep headquarters within the State.  We cannot say, at least not on this record, that any of these assumptions is irrational.  Cf. G.D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U.S. 404, 410, 102 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 71 L.Ed.2d 250 (1982);  Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 585, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540, 79 L.Ed. 1070 (1935).  And upon them Montana may have premised the policy judgment, which we find constitutionally unimpeachable, that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating in the county containing its home office is sufficiently significant to outweigh a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice.", "10", "Of course Montana's venue rules would have implemented that policy judgment with greater precision if they had turned on the location of a corporate defendant's principal place of business, not on its State of incorporation.  But this is hardly enough to make the rules fail rational-basis review, for \"rational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.\"  New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2517, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976);  see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 814, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 2500, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976);  Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1911).  Montana may reasonably have thought that the location of a corporate defendant's principal place of business would not be as readily verifiable as its State of incorporation, that a rule hinging on the former would invite wasteful side shows of venue litigation, and that obviating the side shows would be worth the loss in precision.  These possibilities, of course, put Burlington a far cry away from the point of discharging its burden of showing that the under- and overinclusiveness of Montana's venue rules is so great that the rules can no longer be said rationally to implement Montana's policy judgment.  See, e.g., Brownell, supra, 294 U.S., at 584, 55 S.Ct., at 540.  Besides, Burlington, having headquarters elsewhere, would not benefit even from a scheme based on domicile, and is therefore in no position to complain of Montana's using State of incorporation as a surrogate for domicile.  See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 271 U.S. 50, 53-55, 46 S.Ct. 375, 376-377, 70 L.Ed. 827 (1926);  cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 522, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960).", "11", "Burlington is left with the argument that Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, supra, controls this case.  But it does not.  In Saunders, we considered Arkansas' venue rules, which restricted suit against a domestic corporation to those counties where it maintained a place of business, 274 U.S., at 491-492, 47 S.Ct., at 678-679, but exposed foreign corporations to suit in any county, id., at 492, 47 S.Ct., at 679.  We held that the distinction lacked a rational basis and therefore deprived foreign corporate defendants of the equal protection of the laws.  Id., at 494, 47 S.Ct., at 679.  The statutory provision challenged in Saunders, however, applied only to foreign corporations authorized to do business in Arkansas, ibid., so that most of the corporations subject to its any-county rule probably had a place of business in Arkansas.  In contrast, most of the corporations subject to Montana's any-county rule probably do not have their principal place of business in Montana.  Thus, Arkansas' special rule for foreign corporations was tailored with significantly less precision than Montana's, and, on the assumption that Saunders is still good law, see American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U.S. 637, 645, n. 6, 96 S.Ct. 1800, 1805, n. 6, 48 L.Ed.2d 263 (1976), its holding does not invalidate Montana's venue rules.", "12", "In sum, Montana's venue rules can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest.

If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?", "[Answer]First find the total volume of the pool: 10 feet * 10 feet * 6 feet = 600 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons he needs to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water from the total amount of water Jerry is allowed to use: 1000 gallons - 600 gallons - 100 gallons = 300 gallons. Then divide the amount of water Jerry has left to use for showers by the amount of water per shower to find how many showers he can take: 300 gallons / 20 gallons / shower = 15 showers.
