Some refer to it as Primal Energy. It is what flows through the patterns of reality and what makes magic possible. The primal force, quintessence can not truly be divided, measured, or contained. The patterns of all supernaturals, mortals, inanimate objects, and the whole of the Tellurian is woven from Quintessence. The term literally translates to \"Fifth Essence\".\n\nPatterns are metaphorical vessels of Quintessence, and as such, constitute all known reality, acting as \"lego bricks\" to Prime's \"building blocks\".\n\nThe way that a mage can alter reality is based on 9 spheres of magic.\n\nThose sphere of magic are:\ncorrespondance, the element of connection between apparently different things.\nCorrespondence magic allows powers such as teleportation, seeing into distant areas, levitation, and flying. At higher levels, the Mage may also co-locate themselves or even stack different spaces within each-other. Correspondence can be combined with almost any other sphere to create effects that span distances. Space, interrelationships and sympathetic links all become clear through the study of Correspondence. By bending space or bypassing it entirely, a mage can travel rapidly, fly or teleport from place to place. Divining locations allows the mage to see far-away places or direct magic over distances. With a link between a person and an object, Effects may be targeted through connecting rituals.\n\nentropy: the principle of chance, fate and mortality.\nEntropy concerns itself mainly with the study of order, chaos, luck, and destiny. From this Sphere comes the study of order and randomness, and thus, the study of totally random creation and destruction. All things dissolve eventually into haphazard components, and similar events form from disjointed, unconnected patterns. Mages who study Entropy often choose the path of either order or chaos. Students of order look into patterns, into the ways that events flow from one to the next and into the means by which new things build on the old. Students of chaos study the dissolution of patterns, the destruction of matter and the random elements that infect happenstance and probability.\n\nforces: the understanding of elemental energies.\nForces is the Sphere of energetic Patterns, among them heat, light, vibration, radiation and gravity. In effect, Forces are constructs of Quintessence in motion. Every force has its own unique properties, but they all share the common root of Prime swirling through a Pattern. Although modern physics disputes the old lines between matter and energy, the venerable study of Forces transcends human politics. Science considers certain forces to be the absence of others, while mystical Traditions usually consider negative and positive forces (like heat and cold) to be opposite but independent entities.\n\nlife: The mysteries of life and death.\nLife governs those Patterns that grow, evolve and eventually change. Life patterns differ from the other two static Spheres in that they are not self-contained vessels of Quintessence, but draw on the Tellurian for sustenance and later return these energies. This process only ends when Life transforms into Matter, during the moment of death. As a whole, this Sphere embraces everything that has living cells within itself, even if that object is technically dead. Preserved blood and organs, still-living plants, live-culture cheese, and so forth contain Life, but corpses, cotton fibers, withered organs, or cut wood become Matter.\n\nmatter: The principles behind supposedly “inanimate” objects.\nMatter is the Pattern Sphere that purviews all inorganic Patterns that hold Quintessence, in contrast to the energetic Patterns of Forces and the symbiotic Patterns of Life. Representing the base of the physical world, Matter governs the elements from the periodic table in all their physical conditions (or, to mystics, the three elements of Earth, Air and Water). Manipulating Matter is usually a much simpler affair than manipulating other Patterns.\n\nmind: The potentials of consciousness.\nSince human beings perceive reality through a complex interplay of consciousness, the Mind Sphere affects how a being sees the world around it. Such study leads to the investigation of thought, the existence of perfect forms, the idea of intelligence, and inquiry divorced from mere physical form.\nThe Mind mage can use thought to communicate, control, and wipe away the inaccuracies and errors of human misjudgment for the peaceful serenity of total concentration. All thought is open to the mage: From the refined sensibilities of human philosophy to the feral instincts of animals. Any thinking process can be comprehended and manipulated with sufficient skill.\n\nprime: An understanding of the Primal Energy within all things.\nPrime is the Sphere of magic that governs the raw energy of reality, sometimes called Primal Energy, Quintessence or Odyllic Force. A mage who uses Prime can sense magic of other magi, use the power of the universe to create effects out of nothingness, and can store Quintessence past their Avatar background rating. It is the study of Quintessence, and it is regarded by all the Traditions as a valuable or even holy power. With Prime, magi can create, destroy or reshape the universal energies. A mage can further enchant objects and living creatures with magical energy, fight back the effects of Paradox, use countermagic, and make the changes they exact on the world permanent.\nWhile other Spheres influence the actual stuff of reality, Prime controls the power from which they all spring. Prime moves through the Patterns of Life, Matter, Spirit and Forces, animating them only to be released again when these Patterns expire. It is a cyclic expression of magic itself.\n\nspirit: Comprehension of Otherworldly forces and inhabitants.\nSpirit is the Sphere of the ephemeral stuff that is the building block of the three Umbrae, the realms between the pureness of unbridled Prime and the Patterned World of flesh. Spirit is a homogeneous whole, a sort of conceptual energy given a special form that can mirror or mimic the more mundane Patterns of elements. However, Spirit is much more. It's also the results of emotion, hope, and thought -- the intangible end product of the Mind's musing and shaping. The mage skilled in Spirit can touch the wall that separates potential from material to see beyond.\nSpirit is also needed to communicate or suborn Spirits, the inhabitants of these strange realms. These entities are bound by strange rules and customs mage would do very well to learn, and they can be powerful allies or relentless foes.\n\ntime: The strange workings of chronological forces and perceptions.\nTime is known as the magic that all men know. Science and magic both agree that the flow of time varies with the observer, that time itself is hardly the constant that it initially seems. Esoteric doctrines claim time is an illusion. Even those who accept Time is forward march (more or less) still discover that the eddies, currents and branching paths of time are far more manifold and mutable than most people would ever guess.\nMages studying Time magic agree that the world is full of unexpected whorls and vortices of temporal disturbance. Time contracts around some places and dilates at others, though the regimentation of scientific time means that such phenomena are not as common as they once were. In unusual circumstances, time may loop back on itself, make jumps and rifts to past or future, or diverge in multiple streams.\n\nMoreover each sphere of magic has a level of mastery attached to it.\nlevel 1: the mage is able to perceive and understand in detail the way in which the topic of the sphere behave.\nlevel 2: the mage can manipulate in a minor way the topic of the sphere. He can also alter itself a bit.\nlevel 3: the mage is able to controle the topic of the sphere. At this level the mage is able to damage itself of others with his magic.\nlevel 4: the same as for level 3 but in a bigger scale (the size of a human for exemple).\nlevel 5: the mage totally master the topic of the sphere and is able to produce effect far greater in intensity and size.\n\nKnowing all this, what sphere and level would a mage need to put someone to sleep ?"}, {"id": 25052, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "Can you provide me a holiday itinerary for a trip to Sri Lanka that is suitable for adolescents and adults.

The feature will roll out to users globally in the “coming weeks,” the company says. (How it will work at launch is up for debate: some users were reporting being routed to gas stations instead of EV chargers.)\n\nWaze briefly trialed adding EV chargers to its route planning tool back in 2021 in partnership with Volkswagen. But that trial only lasted a few weeks, and after it concluded, the charging stations vanished from the app. With today’s announcement, Waze has added EV charging “permanently” to the app, a company spokesperson said.\n\nWaze also claims that thanks to its crowdsourced map editing function, “EV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.”\n\n“Charging station information is often inconsistent, outdated or unreliable, creating a major pain point for EV drivers who may navigate to a charging station only to discover they can’t find it or use it,” Waze says in a blog post. “By adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it’s even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you’ll come across the next station.”\n\nWaze is not the only navigation app trying to improve the experience of finding a working EV charger. Google, which owns Waze, has been tweaking its own flagship app, Google Maps, including information about the types of plugs present at certain charging stations and whether those plugs are currently in use. The company also recently upgraded EV charging searches for electric vehicles with Google built-in software.\n\nThere is a host of EV charging navigation tools, from A Better Route Planner to PlugShare to Chargeway. All have their upsides and downsides. But with these new updates, Waze may soon rise to the top of the list of preferred services by EV owners.\nWaze route plans will now include electric vehicle charger locations\nEV drivers now have one more option for planning the best route with charging.\n\nElectric vehicle-specific navigation is coming to Waze. The map app is rolling out new data beginning today that now includes EV charger location information, which it will use to help EV drivers plan routes.\n\nThe new app feature will let you specify your EV type and the relevant charging plug, which you can use to filter just the appropriate charging stations. Waze says that its community will review and update the map data \"in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.\"\n\nWaze's addition of EV charger location data now gives EV drivers yet another route-planning tool. Apps like PlugShare and A Better Route Planner are both widely used by EV drivers to find chargers, and both Apple Maps and Google Maps have EV-routing features now as well.\n\nAnd as EV drivers already know, it's common practice for all but the barest-bones EV to feature charger locations in their onboard navigation system. In fact, it can be preferable to use that option rather than casting from one's phone, as many EVs will precondition the battery for faster charging if the native navigation app has a charger set as the destination.\n\nWaze will begin rolling out the EV data from today, although it says it will do so globally \"over the coming weeks.\""}, {"id": 25123, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": ":\nYou are given a code snippet for a Python unit test file that may belong to a larger codebase.

Given material: Is the spotlight fading on Ed Miliband’s leadership? Labour appears to have sleepwalked into a leadership crisis. But how likely are claims of a new leader to replace him before the 2015 general election? And who might replace him? Is Ed Miliband on borrowed time? Can he survive the weekend? Until Christmas? Until next year’s election? In the last 72 hours Labour has been plunged into panic with talk of poisonous briefings and even claims that a letter is circulating calling for Mr Miliband to stand aside. But why now? What exactly is troubling the party that was not doing so six months ago? And is there anything in any of this beyond feverish speculation? Well, yes and no. First, the speculation. As of yet no such “letter” has been seen. No MP has come out on the record in favour of ousting their leader. Nor are any of the recent criticisms of his leadership particularly new. Mr Miliband has long suffered an image problem. There have been flashes of policy inspiration, but he has struggled to broaden his appeal beyond core Labour voters. Some say the cost-of-living-crisis is not permeating with quite the policy punch he would hope. What has changed for Mr Miliband recently is the acuteness of his problems. Consider the above against the more pressing backdrop of a collapse in his personal poll ratings, the rise of the SNP threatening to scorch 20 of Labour’s 41 Scottish seats (crucial for a 2015 victory). Add the Greens garnering greater support – not to mention Ukip broadening its appeal among the working class. Suddenly the picture changes. Problems that were once platitudes now have a crushing urgency to be resolved. Indeed, by this analysis Labour is not just drifting. It is failing to pre-empt contemporary political threats – and, thanks to new, credible alternatives, heading to the humiliation of defeat where victory once seemed likely. That is a particularly rude awakening for MPs, many of whom feel the downward trajectory is difficult to curtail at this late stage. Add that to the New Statesman magazine appearing to withdraw its once-default support for Mr Miliband, and it soon becomes clear why the mood inside Labour HQ has plummeted. But could this really result in a change of leader before the election? The prospect is not impossible but it is still difficult to imagine. Firstly, Labour’s historical record in ousting a leader is nothing short of abysmal. Party rules mean that a vote of no-confidence can only be marshalled during the party’s annual conference – which was six weeks ago. For the moment, curmudgeonly backbenchers seem happier complaining off-the-record about their leader than putting their head above the parapet and pitching an alternative. And that’s hardly surprising. Labour’s MP’s are not known to be forward about coming forward. One only need remember 2009 during Gordon Brown’s premiership which saw former pensions secretary James Purnell’s dramatic resignation, in which he called for the then prime minister to stand aside “to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election”. It was followed in 2010 by simultaneous resignations by Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon. But neither of these were enough to move Mr Brown, who went on to lose the election himself five months later. Mr Miliband appears just as resilient. The prospect of him grabbing his coat and exiting stage left is unlikely. Three MPs are understood to have told Dave Watts, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party that Mr Miliband should stand down. But it will need far more than that – as well as a clear contingency plan – for any chance of a leadership shift. Finally, the perennial question that hampers any immediate prospect of change. Who exactly would replace him? Who could actually do a better job? And who could stave off the prospect of a party implosion that would almost inevitably follow? With no clear contender to challenge Mr Miliband, talk of a change of leader remains just that. Here are five potential successors. The shadow health secretary is currently the leading candidate. His performances at the last Labour conference were impressive, where Mr Miliband’s were not. His dogged campaigning on the Hillsborough tragedy has won admiration across parliament. His working class roots are of contrast to Mr Miliband who the New Statesman described as an “old-style Hampstead socialist”. One of the more accomplished performers, who has been impressive head-to-head against Home Secretary Theresa May. The shadow home secretary would have the support of her husband, Ed Balls. But that could also be to her detriment. Many believe Balls is too closely linked to the Brown and Miliband era. He is already tipped as a future Labour leader but an elevation to the top post may seem premature for the 36-year-old. Instead the shadow business secretary called on the party to focus on “communities, rather than the distracting nonsense by some in the Westminster bubble”. The shadow welfare secretary has had a meteoric rise entering the shadow cabinet 18 months after election despite being described by the editor of BBC Newsnight as “boring snoring”. A former UK junior chess champion and Bank of England economist is among a number of Labour MPs who have been tipped for leadership positions but whose time may not be yet. She wrote on Twitter: “A Labour government will make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people. But we’ll only get one if we stay united behind Ed Miliband”. The former postman who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, appears to value his private life and has all but ruled himself out last month when he said he had “no appetite for being on the frontbench” let alone a potential prime minister which he described as a “god-awful job”."}, {"id": 25127, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are tasked with implementing a control mechanism for a pitch angle.

He was an upright man of integrity; he feared God and shunned what was bad. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. His livestock amounted to 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys, along with a very large number of servants, so that he became the greatest of all the people of the East.\nEach of his sons would hold a banquet at his house on his own set day. They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. After a series of banquet days was complete, Job would send for them in order to sanctify them. Then he would get up early in the morning and offer up burnt sacrifices for each of them. For Job said: “Maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.” That is what Job would always do.\nNow the day came when the sons of the true God\\*f entered to take their station before Jehovah,g and Satanh also entered among them.\nThen Jehovah said to Satan: “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Jehovah: “From roving about on the earth and from walking about in it.” And Jehovah said to Satan: “Have you taken note of\\* my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.” At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have you not put up a protective hedge around himm and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands,n and his livestock has spread out in the land. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence\\* of Jehovah.\nNow on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,p 14 a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them 15 when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n16 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “Fire from God\\* fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n17 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “The Chal·deʹansq formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword.

Our history makes cynicism and refusal to be one big easy target a survival trait handed down from generation to generation. Black people born in America never got to see Black people united like African and Haitians. Division kept our labor cheap, uprisings down and power non-existent.      So this Web3 community push seems lost on the culture, but we were built for this and don't know it yet. Our history is full of us developing our societies within American society specifically for us like Black clubs, Black barbershops, Black beauty salons. Our mothers traded knowledge that kept us fed on shoe string budgets (fried food kept longer) and our leaders were made in secret least they be targeted. Our hood is one big \"Decentralized Autonomous Organization\" with its own economy and justice in spite of America's society.      Our secret societies were demonized, our ways seen as savage, until they were copied and made mainstream. Been that way since the dancing in juke joints was seen as savage and deviant until Elvis, backwards hats was seen as thuggish and ghetto at first, before \"bling\" was in a Zales commercial, it was seen as the reason why Black people stay impoverished and Lil Wayne complained about it in a song. I'm old enough to remember when rap was evil and the cause of the crack epidemic. Eminem is compared to Elvis for a reason.  The Cool Factor  This leads me to Black Twitter, you see in 2009, Twitter was barely getting celebrities to buy into it. 3rd party apps were allowed to keep developers as users. Then Black people like me used the open space to promote our podcasts, developed fans and networked as a community. We did things like fake RT, set a community standard that after midnight explicit tweets were allowed and our network grew. Mobile app developers created an entire market around it.      Live tweets? We used to call it \"watching a show as a family\". Our reaction to Game of Throne's Red Wedding episode, my favorite Black Twitter event ever, made that show a global phenomenon. My Game of Thrones shirt that I wore to a beach party got a lot of attention from female book fans that saw their fandom get a credibility boost. The ladies I attended the party had to pull me away and later joked that \"Pam\" was two drinks away from asking to see my dragon. By the season finale of the show, the author had to write a new book for the new audience and HBO's spinoff is on it's 3rd episode as I type this.      Black Twitter: Influence goes Global      Black Twitter made Empire, Blackish, Scandal and Black Jesus ratings juggernauts. Marvel's Civil War movie saw Black Twitter choose sides with hashtags and #TeamCap claiming victory. #TeamCap also claims credit for the scene with Black Panther and Captain America in Avengers: Endgame. HBO's Insecure's star used to be the Insecure Black Girl account on Black Twitter. Quinta Brunson also went from the TL to her own sitcom. Black Panther became a such a global phenomenon that Marvel's rival DC still hasn't recovered. Captain America's portal scene with Black Panther in Endgame was their thanks to the culture for some. DC looked so uncool and white that Batman roast sessions were common on Twitter.     Black Lives Matter sentiment hit Batman who was seen as an overzealous cop and a privileged rich white kid they couldn't relate to instead of the caped crusader who targeted anonymous thugs and supervillains. Black Twitter's roast sessions were acknowledged in a Batman movie, DC's best PR move.    Black Twitter: Unpaid Innovators      Now imagine all of our creativity that made networks rich being harnessed and sold as a community with payment automatically distributed according to contribution and each transaction down to the penny being publicly available. Rap labels without the embezzlement or bad contracts, equal pay for men and women, no Black leaders or religion, and a win for one is a win for all. My viral video just gave the community more promotion and more eyes for your music label who's album cover was part of an NFT collection that is more valuable now for all the token holders.      Class is video and audio based with 5 minutes being seen as too long. Not only does graduation increase your skills, your cap can also be used as a coupon for discounts and a badge to post on Facebook to make mama proud. \"Decentralized\" as in segregated and secured networks like your home Wifi, not like your phone company's network. \"Autonomous\" just means we rule and sustain our own people and \"Organization\" means we're a collective, a community, a Metaverse gang with our own hood that we built and own ourselves.

But the Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has opened discussions with the Pentagon about delaying their departure until late January, according to an official who was not authorized to speak on the record.\nIf approved, the extension would represent another expansion of the military border operation, whose scope has steadily grown since President Trump rushed troops to border posts in Arizona, Texas and California shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm election.\nAn extension would keep troops away from home through the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, which would intensify criticism of the operation from Democrats, who have called the operation wasteful and unnecessary.\nOnly last week, the White House authorized troops along the border to detain, search, and if necessary use deadly force to protect other U.S. government personnel, a major change in the military role but one that Pentagon officials insisted would only be employed in dire emergencies.\nThousands of migrants are in the Mexican cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. Some clashed earlier this week at the San Ysidro border crossing with Border Patrol agents, who fired tear gas to prevent them from seeking to rush the border en masse. Unarmed U.S. troops were seen moving razor wire to block the attempted crossing.\nIf the mission is extended, one official said, the Pentagon could rotate new troops to the border and send some personnel who have been living in makeshift camps since October back to their home bases.\nThe Defense Department has sought to keep tight limits on the border operation. At the same time, other administration officials who advocate aggressive efforts to block immigration have sought to expand the military role to buttress the president’s incendiary charges that caravans of migrants moving north through Mexico pose an imminent threat to U.S. security.\nThe Homeland Security department has not made a formal request for an extension, Pentagon officials said.\nDefense Secretary James N. Mattis told reporters Wednesday the two departments were in discussions about whether an extension was required.\nMattis added that the troops had largely completed their original mission of strengthening protections with razor wire fences and vehicle barriers at dozens of legal border crossings, known as ports of entry.\nThat could lead commanders of the operation to send home engineering and logistics troops who have been installing the additional barriers. Military police who would be called on in case of a riot or other large-scale attempt to cross the border would likely remain, along with support troops, helicopter units and other specialized troops.\nIt’s unclear whether the overall size of the force would shrink if an extension were approved.\nMattis played down the possibility that troops could be involved in use of force against migrants, saying the Border Patrol had shown its capability of securing the border without direct involvement by troops.\nMattis did not address why the troops would need to stay on the border if the Border Patrol could handle security.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you provide a summary of the potential extension of U.S. troops along the southwest border and the reactions it has received from Democrats?"}, {"id": 25364, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "Next Question: Premise: \"A team of canadian hockey players is sitting together.\"\nHypothesis: \"Sports players on the same team are sitting nearby.\"\nDo we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\nMy Answer: Let's think.

So frankly, when the trend for flouncy ruffles started to bubble, it struck fear into many a minimalists heart. Thankfully this isn't about rewinding to the '80s hey-day of giant frilly dresses. Instead, designers have given us options. And there are a few lessons to be learnt in how to wear these ruffles well. On paper, pink and ruffles should have been too sickly sweet to make the cut. But in reality A Détacher's designer Monika Kowalska has managed to make a very modern, simple dress. Tick. Karl's turned the pretty dial up to eleven with this lacy number. Black boots and tights keeps the dress from being too bridal. Who would have thought it, pure girly frills in lilac and peach are literally the best combination. Like Karl, black accessories keep it from getting too Sandra Dee. Silky flamenco ruffles, cut out shoulders and a skirt slashed to the thigh banishes any feeling that frills mean frump. The Rodarte sisters have a particular brand of 'gothic romanticism' that walks the perfect line between gritty and girly. Case in point, their leather frilly jacket. Grey jersey is given new life with a smattering of frills at Stella. But if you try it at home, this much fabric calls for a pointed heel. The 1980s were arguably the glory days for the ruffle. Valentino's 'ra-ra skirt' dress gives a nice little nod to the decade but thankfully there are no leg warmers in sight. Make like Henry Holland's girls and toughen up your ruffles with a dark belt and some mesh.

Even though both of these processes appear to work quite differently over the surface, it is crucial that you understand that they’re really inseparable, and both must increase the traffic to your site.\nIn prior days, increasing traffic was as straightforward as altering around link constructions, including key words here and there, or experimentation with your metas. When those components were set up, you could begin creating more links on your website and sit back and watch your traffic increase.\nNow, that process is a bit more complex. You have likely heard it before, however Google favors (more like:”expects”) high quality articles over everything .\n“Content is king” is just one of these Clicks From Search agency which won’t ever go away. If you do not have great information, you won’t rank quite well, and that is a truth.\nHowever, at precisely the exact same time, in order for folks to really locate your high-quality articles, you’ve got to get a good SEO approach to back this up.\nThe best, most despicable, and incredibly persuasive words will not help your bottom line whatsoever if Google does not see your complete site as one which features value or follows best practices.\nAs mentioned before, SEO and articles advertising are two distinct processes. You could clarify the most important difference such as this: SEO is technical and narrow, whilst articles promotion is holistic and broad.\nWhile this looks like a stark comparison, it really makes for a marriage which operates efficiently and cohesively.\nWhile there lots of gaps between SEO and articles promotion, in addition, there are many places where they overlap. Taking advantage of the overlap and utilizing it on your site is your fastest way to get more visitors to see your website.\nThus, let us take a peek at where SEO and articles advertising come together.\nYou can rank fresh pages using SEO and articles. SEO is all about rank high on search indicators, which can not occur without you generating new, excellent content. Since you make new pages, you create opportunities for new positions and much more reach. This, then, contributes to more key words you may rank for. Bear in mind, however, that amount should not trump quality. Better content provides you better positions .\nYou can optimize key words along with your own content. Using key words in your articles lets you reach better more varied audiences, including market audiences. The trick to that is using key words obviously inside your own content.\nQuality articles provides you authority. Ranking high on search engines depends on many different different facets, including that the standard of the content that you compose . As you utilize content to deliver key words and reach viewers, you will rank high in search engines and boost authority by means of your site traffic.\nIt is not unusual for site owners to concentrate strictly on one facet of their SEO/content coin and overlook the other.\nSEO and articles advertising both bring significant elements to the internet advertising and marketing table, and you also want them both to actually grow your small business. It is frequently a really large and complicated picture that has to get everything working together to provide the best outcomes.\nIf a business were to only begin to concentrate on something such as blogging at the cost of SEO time, then they might begin to observe a fall in overall positions.\nOn the other hand, if that exact same firm were to fixate entirely on link building and need to view 18 new high quality links daily, they will probably not have sufficient new content to encourage link building on such scale.\nIn the long run, SEO needs so much content since it needs to grow. Google does not need to realize a stagnant, unchanging site. It needs to know you are building up powerful, useful and appropriate articles so that it can provide the best outcomes for each search.\nAlthough it is possible to use SEO on the very same pages repeatedly, you will discover that it is much more successful when it is pulling this fresh content beneath its wings, linking it all together, and shoving all of it up the search engine ranks.\nThe important thing is to utilize SEO and articles promotion jointly. Yes, SEO requires a whole lot of articles, but it does not mean that you ought to pin all your hopes on this single component of internet marketing. We wish to come at this from all angles.\nMaybe blogs are not exactly what you need at this time. Perhaps you need to think about a few long-form, evergreen content rather . Perhaps we ought to get your user interface upgraded before we begin delving into connection building.\nThere’s a good deal of moving parts, here, that explains exactly why making a balance between the two is extremely significant.\nAnd it could be simpler than you think.\nFirst, identify the reason for your site. If you wish to just draw in customers, concentrate more on SEO strategies that drive traffic to your website. If you’d like higher conversion rates when people get to your website, content promotion is much more important.\nFor the most part, but you need to aim to drive traffic to your website and convert them as soon as they arrive. As you make this balance, you are guaranteed to see your traffic and conversion rates grow."}, {"id": 25464, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Does knowledge have limits?"}, {"id": 25465, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "when push the code auto generated build"}, {"id": 25466, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "code that makes images wrap to the right in sets of 5"}, {"id": 25467, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "leader of sikh empire who became maharajah of punjab"}, {"id": 25468, "actor": "Chatbots & Social Media Integration", "prompt": "what is digital skip tracing"}, {"id": 25469, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "Arrange the following list of animals based on their size and weight, and provide the average weight and height of each animal in both metric and imperial units.

What if the story had been written from a biblical, Christian perspective? One might say that the boy was born to a godless woman who neither cared for God nor for His gift of a child, a woman who exhibited the works of the flesh rather than the fruit of the Spirit, who herself had either never heard of or else rebelled against the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who was her only hope of salvation. Thus she brought up her son in the same sinful manner in which she herself lived, rather than in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.\nGoals and values become secularized and personcentered rather than sacred and God-centered.

If obedience to God is the motivation rather than pragmatism, they may very well be pleasing God and having success. But, if the motive is for success and because it works, they may become discouraged when it doesn’t work and try something else.\n2:12).

The basic unit of communication will no longer be typed out in e-mails. It will be shot in pictures and shown on video. Companies have already discovered that the written word is failing them. Its feebleness compared with the moving image was rammed home in 2010 when the sight of BP's oil spewing out into the Gulf of Mexico on YouTube sent a message to the world far more compelling than any written statement could ever be. If the word has become weak at conveying big corporate messages, it has become even weaker at conveying small ones. For years the in-boxes of all office workers have been overflowing with unread e-mails. But managers will do something about it and desist from communicating with staff in this way. E-mail will still exist as a way of talking to one person at a time, but as a means of mass communication it will be finished. Companies will find instead that to get a message over to employees, customers, shareholders and the outside world, video is far more effective. In the past three years video has come from nothing to make up nearly half of internet traffic; in another three, it is likely to be more than three-quarters. So far corporations have taken a back seat in this growth, but they will soon need to climb into the front and start to drive it. This shift in communications will have three important effects. It will change the sort of person who makes it to the corner office. It will alter the way that businesses are managed. And it will shift the position corporations occupy in society and possibly make us like some of them just a little bit more. The new corporate leaders will no longer be pen pushers and bean counters. The 20-year reign of faceless bosses will come to an end. Charisma will be back in: all successful business chiefs will have to be storytellers and performers. Just as political leaders have long had to be dynamite on TV to stand much hope of election or survival, so too will corporate leaders. They must be able to sell not only their vision of their companies but their vision of themselves. The new big boss will be expected to set an example; any leaders showing signs of human frailty will be out on their ears. The moral majority will tighten its hold on corporate life, first in America, but then elsewhere too. With this shift will come a change in management style. Numbers and facts will be supplanted by appeals to emotion to make employees and customers do what they are told. The businessperson's emotion may be no more genuine than the politician's, but successful bosses will get good at faking it. Others will struggle: prepare to cringe in as corporate leaders spout a lot of phoney stuff that used to look bad enough when written down, but will sound even worse spoken. One good consequence of the change, however, will be a greater clarity in the way companies think about their businesses. The written word was a forgiving medium for over-complicated, ill-conceived messages. Video demands simplicity. The best companies will use this to their advantage by thinking through more rigorously what it is they are trying to say and do.\nB: Large corporations are already using video extensively."}, {"id": 25490, "actor": "Job Application & Customer Management", "prompt": "Can you help me figure out how to ask my boss for a raise based on my skills and time at the company?"}, {"id": 25491, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "What are the bases to consider when determining if the online journal Web sites are reliable?"}, {"id": 25492, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "What does the fox say?"}, {"id": 25493, "actor": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "prompt": "Context: At school today John was not present.

Penebella's Anti Aging Under Eye Cream is specifically formulated to reduce the appearance of puffiness and bags under the eyes, while also minimizing wrinkles, dark circles, and discoloration.\nPROVIDES INTENSE HYDRATION: This hydrating formula keeps your eye area feeling glowing and smooth all day long, thanks to its powerful natural ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid, Collagen, and Retinol. The skin care cream is super rich in Avocado Oil, providing extra moisture to dry areas around the eyes while protecting against free radicals.\nNATURAL INGREDIENTS. Penebella's Anti Aging Eye Cream Balm contains a blend of natural ingredients that help to rejuvenate and protect the delicate skin around your eyes.\nFREE FROM CHEMICALS: Your skin deserves the BEST! This is exactly why we've created Penebella puffy eyes and dark circles treatment. Free from sulfates and paraben, this eye puffiness reducer has been tested by an independent laboratory for safety, efficacy, and quality of ingredients, so you can apply it with confidence.\nNON-STICKY, QUICK ABSORBING: This lightweight, non-sticky under-eye cream for puffiness and bags absorbs quickly and works to strengthen, illuminate and brighten the eye area. Our eye cream for dark circles is perfect for all skin types and gentle enough for daily use without irritation. Suitable for women as well as men.\n\nThese is the main points from the negative reviews:\n1 No scent, not much needed, however after use of 2 weeks still no difference\n2 I’ve been using it for almost a month and I don’t see any difference, my under bags are still really dark.\n3 After several applications all i noticed was that it left areas of my eyes greasy looking. No visible signs that it reduced wrinkles, bags or brightening.\n4 So after 2 weeks of using 2x daily, I can tell a little bit of a difference in the fine lines but the dark circles are no better. \n5 This product was really great for moisture for my eye area and kept it feeling soft throughout the day but it became a little oily after about 6 hours. I didn’t see a ton of dark circle improvement but did notice some lightning.\n6 The product moisturizes under the eyes but I don’t notice a difference. Been using it for 2 weeks\nIt didn't lighten my dark circles. Nor did it help my wrinkles. I do like that the cream is lightweight and not greasy. \n7 This is an eye cream that promises to brighten the skin around your eyes and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. While it does a great job of moisturizing my eyes and, even with the hyaluronic acid, it doesn't irritate the skin around my eyes. It's done a great job at reducing the appearance of wrinkles, it has done little to brighten the dark circles under my eyes. \nAfter a month of usage, i got an undereye rash, and its painful and obvi a reaction.\n\nThere is the main points from the positive reviews:\n1 Definitely very moisturizing, my eyes tend to burn a lot when using most products around the eye area but this one has been very gentle and feels soothing. \n2 The product works quite well. I don't see any immediate results with the bags around my eyes. But, I can see my skin is renewing because there's a slight flaking of my skin, which is normal with products containing good levels of retinol. It doesn't really irritate my eyes, which is rare for a product with retinol in it.\n3 Under-eye bags are not as puffy and seem to be getting better. doesn’t happen overnight as I hoped for but good to see progress.\n4 The smooth texture and pure ingredients\n5 This does seem to be working for my dark circles. Will continue to use it.\n6 no irritation, and works well for brightening my under-eye area!\n7 my eyes were less puffy after the first application and after 2 weeks of use I'm noticing that my dark circles are getting lighter!\n8 I’ve been using this product for over a month now and have very few complaints. I haven’t noticed too much of a difference with any fine lines or wrinkles, but the dark bags under my eyes are almost non-existent. As a mom of 5 who gets little sleep, this has really helped me not look as “zombie-ish” after rough nights. I also have sensitive skin and tend to breakout with new products and this has not caused any breakouts for me! But my favorite thing about this cream is the light jasmine scent.\n9 I loved the scent and the consistency of the product.\n10 I've only used this product for a few days, but I love the feel of this cream under my eyes. A little goes a long way. Not overly scented, and no adverse reaction to my sensitive eye area. I will update this review after I've used the product for 30 days.\n11 Great eye cream for those with eye bags! The formula is smooth and creamy, and smells strongly of Jasmine essential oil (it is one of the listed ingredients). The formula is a bit thick, but it’s not so bad if you use it sparingly. The price is fair and affordable! It’s worth it for the price. I’ve noticed a difference in my fine-lines around my eyes, they seem to be softer thanks to this cream!\n12 I was looking for a product to reduce darkness and puffiness under the eye area. While the product does moisturize the area I did not see any difference in reducing puffiness and dark circles.\n13 Moisturizes well but I’m not sure if it significantly helps with bags.\n14 I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and my dark circles are noticeably lighter.\n15 My under eye bags are much lighter and my face looks brighter \n16 After a few days I could tell a marked difference with my dark circles.\n17 Definitely brightened and hydrated under my eyes\n\n18 I recently purchased this eye cream to use. I expected it to be more in quantity though. I did like that they contain avocado oil. Actually, it contains collagen and retinol as well, which are found in some of my other products.\n19 This eye cream is a miracle worker! It brightens my dark circles and reduces puffiness around my eyes. I also love how smooth and soft it makes my skin feel. It's incredibly hydrating and provides a nice base for my other skincare products. \n20 My skin is very sensitive so it’s hard for me to find creams that work and don’t irritate my skin. This eye cream is light weight and feels lovely on my skin and does not have an over bearing scent. It does not have that greasy feeling or that thick paste feeling. It does not affect the look of your makeup under your eyes. It was very hydrating and it definitely helped with my puffiness and dark circles. As a mother of 5 this cream is easy to use and it’s quick to apply. It is free of chemicals and has my top 10 ingredients that I look for in the products I use on my face.\n21 It moisturized which is no big deal as there are loads of eye creams out there that will do that. But the shadows minimized within a few days and the bags started to disappear shortly after that. It's been less than a month and I'm very pleased with the improvement in my undereye area. \n22 I’ve been using this cream twice per day since the end of January (review in March), and have noticed less darkness and puffiness under my eyes!\n\n23 It’s getting rid of my dark circles under my eyes and makes my eyes brighter while reducing the sleepy look! I use it everyday as part of my skincare routine and I’m so glad I did! \n24 The packaging was nice and the product was easy to get out. It smells good too! It didn’t feel oily or cakey like some other eye creams. It is a quick, simple step that I will add to my everyday skincare routine!\n25 I have tried thousands of products to help with my dart circle. All I can said I was about to give up but I’m glad I didn’t . Just trust the process, after applying twice a day so Morning and nights I started noticing the results by 3 week for the dark circle, but the lines were pretty much gone in two days .

everything this book has to offer  we're going to go over flow states the top 10 brave foods to supercharge your  brain the four modern day villains that are  holding you back how to find your laser focus the eight intelligences  unlocking your memory and heaps more let's jump into it  alright so i'm super excited to be breaking down this book today  this was by far one of my favorite books i've read this year mainly because i found this book to be super practical  and it seemed more like a practical guide than just a heap of  uh information about self-help  at the end of each section there were plenty of practice exercises that you  could implement into your life straight away  so the book is broken down into four main parts  freeing your mind mindset motivation and methods so what is mindset  the deeply held beliefs attitudes and assumptions we create about who we are  how the world works and what we are  capable of and deserve and what is possible this anecdote comes a little bit later in the book but i found it  a useful example so i'd like to share it here first  he gives an example of a young elephant that is chained to a stake in the ground  and as the elephant grows into a fully mature elephant  its mind has placed limitations on itself  although it could easily rip the small flimsy stake out of the ground   to be free  it has developed this learned helplessness so it doesn't even try  and the book goes into this concept of unlimiting which is the act or process of casting aside inaccurate  and restrictive perceptions and embracing the reality that with the  right mindset motivation and   methods there are no limitations  so the book is broken down into these sections accordingly  mindset motivation and methods and this is the core philosophy of the book  modern day supervillains the 4ds these are the modern day villains that  15 years ago we weren't even dealing with  so let me introduce the four villains and then i'll give you some of the remedies that the author suggests for each one  the first of the d's is digital deluge compared to the 15th century we now  consume as much data in a single day as an average person from the 1400s would  have absorbed in their entire lifetime so that is  amazing and we are being bombarded with data  we're always switched on we're always hooked up to the net  humans today are consuming three times more than our parents in the 1960s  there's just too much information too much neural activity going on and all of that extra activity can have ill effects on our brains  it can lead to things like brain fog subpar memory and fatigue  chances are that you guys have probably felt that body fatigue after a long  period  in front of a screen the second d is digital distraction so  we live here now and because of our always-on  ever-connected devices we're struggling to find connection when we're with  friends and family and we're struggling to stay focused at work  so this is where we live now we're connected to the web in every downtime moment waiting for the bus waiting in a line  um we need to think what happens when this is our constant way of being  when every downtime moment is filled with shining screens and all this extra  stimulus this is leading to less social  interaction with friends and family because our devices make us feel more  secure but actually we're less happy next  digital dementia neuroscientist manfred spitzer uses the term digital dementia  to describe how overuse of digital technology  results in the breakdown of cognitive abilities he argues that short-term memory pathways will start to deteriorate from  under use if we overuse technology in the past we  needed to remember things like people's phone  numbers street addresses things like this  now millennials obtain all their answers to problems at the click of a mouse  or the swipe of a finger the reliance on technology to solve every question  confuses people's perception of their own knowledge and intelligence  and that reliance may well lead to overconfidence and poor decision making  before the internet we didn't have the immediate and readily available access  to the opinions of others we needed to reflect  reason draw our own conclusions from our own  insights so if technology is doing all the deductions for us they also found that the longer that person had been driving the larger the  hippocampus was in their brain so in short the brain is malleable it's  able to expand and change over time and it  can change its structure to meet its cognitive load  our second brain is the brain in our gut or the ens  the enteric nervous system scientists don't know everything there is to know  about the smaller brain however they are  beginning to understand how it can affect our mood and our behavior  without going into too much detail it is believed that the second brain in our and your physical condition of your body physiology  so you might want to ask yourself how motivated  and energized are you to learn what you have to learn  what are some things you can do to change your state maybe change your  posture  do some stretching some breathing exercises  you can try some of these before you sit down to study  t is for teach if you want to cut your learning curve dramatically  learn with the intention of teaching the information to someone else  e is for enter what is the simplest and most powerful of someone with steel genius would be sergey brin of google  the main concept here is that genius extends beyond academics  so don't limit yourself by negative self-talk like  i'm just not intelligent i always got bad grades at college so therefore i  mustn't even be in the realm of genius  you can be a mixture of different geniuses so have a think about what your  genius is and let it free  overcoming limiting beliefs before we go  over the steps that he advises to overcome limiting beliefs like man i always screw up this sort of thing or  i'm just not a good companion to be around try to counteract that with  something like um just because i haven't always been good at this  in the past doesn't mean that i can't be  great at this now and in the future so  that is step one make sure you get to the source of it and identify it give it  a name step two get to the facts the steak is  small in size i'm a strong fully grown elephant what  is to stop me from ripping that steak right out of the ground if you believe it can grow and then you can put in the work to make it grow  lie number two we only use ten percent of our brains  new belief i am learning to use my whole brain  in the best way possible line number three mistakes are failures  the new belief you want to create is that mistakes are signs that you're  trying something new and they are opportunities to learn life  isn't about comparing yourself to anyone else  it's about comparing yourself to who you were yesterday  there's no such thing as failure only a failure to learn s3 to prevent us from getting overwhelmed and  paralyzed let's go a little bit deeper into purpose  as we establish earlier we don't have to enjoy something to be motivated to do it  however you do need to have a clear purpose for  why you were doing something you can ask yourself  why must i study this or why must i learn this  the book also outlines not to get confused between  passion and purpose your purpose is what you are here on earth for  and maybe it is to help people so the author jim's passion is learning but his values allow him to choose what things to pursue in life  and what things to deny he doesn't mind having  uh fomo which he he calls fomo which is the fear of missing out  especially if that thing that he is being asked to be a part of doesn't  in any way contribute to his values or his uh purpose in life  and he uh he actually had a word uh which i'm currently blank on  uh uh jomo uh jomo he said to encourage you to have  jomo which is the joy of missing out instead of fomo the fear of missing out you know attainable chunks it become it became manageable  flow state okay let's take a  quote from the book i'm sure there have been times when you were  so completely caught up in what you were doing that everything else disappeared  and it just felt like the most natural thing you've ever done  time probably melted away from you during those experiences  people regularly tell me about focusing so deeply on what they are doing  that they had no idea that afternoon had become night  or they had missed multiple meals in the process vision is competing for your brain's finite energy  so a messy desk with many different objects and colors  will make your brain more fatigued than having a tidy clean desk without  any distractions and this is essential that all  all distractions are eliminated because it can take almost  20 minutes to refocus and get back into the flow  if you get kicked out of it by a distraction so  make sure you do whatever you can to eliminate any potential distractions  next allow enough time if you're serious about getting into a flow state at least 90 minutes for whatever i'm focusing on  the final part of this book is part three which is methods the how  when the billionaire investor warren buffett was asked what factor do you  feel has been the most important in getting to where you've gotten in life  buffered immediately replied focus and bill gates who is sitting next to him  agreed steve jobs has also harped on the importance of focus  for steve jobs focus was the ability to say no to almost everything  and carefully choose what to spend his precious time on the breathing techniques also fail the only thing you can do next is to  confront that stress uh confront that thing that is causing  you stress and lastly schedule time in your  calendar for whatever is distracting you or giving you distress  okay moving on study why are most of us restrained in our  ability ability to study most people do not know how to study of  effectively because they were never taught  many people naturally assume they already know how to learn  the challenge is that most of the techniques that we use now impact on your success be aware of your posture  if you're slumped over this can stifle your breathing  and it will make you prematurely tired so you want to sit up straight improve  your posture and see if you can feel or see if you  can change that state  the sixth habit is to listen with your whole brain  so you want to get better at listening and actually listening  to someone when they're speaking not just waiting to reply to the person  so you want to hold yourself actively listen  don't think about your to-do list or what you're going to watch on netflix if you're trying to remember someone's someone's name when you first hear it  you want to try and link it to a visual image so  if their last name is baker then you might want to imagine  a baker with a big white hat next is to link words via association  so try to link new information to old information  if you can associate the new information with something that you're  already familiar with it will greatly improve your memory  so what comes to your mind when you think of a cherry perhaps red suddenly it starts raining batteries and berries  the balloons pop and the berries splatter all over the ground  so we could continue in that fashion but i think you get the idea  you could break down each line of the periodic table into a short story  or you could break down each list that you have into  a short story and that will greatly help  you to memorize the information  okay so let's move down here to speed reading  now he dedicates quite a few pages to speed reading in the book  but for the purpose of this summary i'll so this is where you make sure that you've addressed everything  on the agenda and within this mental model  i think this is a great exercise to do if you're in  if you're by yourself or in a team and the reason why i think this is a great  mental model is because what most people do is they view  problems from their own perspective that that one perspective and what i  think this method allows you to do is view the problem from multiple  different perspectives the eight intelligences  why is it important for us to have tools to help us think in different ways nearly 100 years now so a visual learner is someone who  prefers to learn through pictures videos and  charts an auditory learner is someone who prefers to learn through listening  and a kinesthetic learner is someone who prefers to have some kind of physical  interaction or hands-on approach  if you guys are interested in finding out what type of learner you are  go ahead grab a copy of this book as it gives you a quiz  that helps you find which learning style you are  for myself i was a visual learner ordered thinking and consequences so let's say you decide that you're  going to buy a subscription to netflix because  everyone's using netflix and it's a cool thing to do so why not  so this is where most people's thinking resides  in the first order most people don't even get to that second order of  thinking  but let's uh let's ask ourselves and then what  well you're going to need to get your money's worth right  so the average netflix subscriber watches around one hour of netflix per all right so that brings us to the end of this summary guys we covered  freeing your mind mindset  motivation and the methods to becoming limitless  so i hope you guys enjoyed this summary i really enjoyed  putting it together if you did get some value out of this video please like  comment and subscribe to the channel because it really does help guys thank  you and if you would like me to summarize a  book that you're interested in please don't hesitate just drop it in  the comments below thank you so much\""}, {"id": 25504, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a five

Such expressions are known as measures of dispersion since they indicate how values are dispersed throughout a population. The variance is the average or mean of the squares of the distance each data point in a set is from the mean of all the data points in the set. Mathematically, variance is represented as σ2, according to the equation: σ2 = [(x1-μ)2 + (x2-μ)2 + (x3-μ)2 +...(xn-μ)2]/n; where x1,2,3,.....n are the values of specific variables; μ is the mean, or average, of all the values; and n is the total number of values. Variance is commonly replaced in applications by its square root, which is known as the standard deviation or σ.\nVariance is one of several measures of dispersion which are used to evaluate the spread of a distribution of numbers. Such measures are important because they provide ways of obtaining information about data sets without considering all of the elements of the data individually.\nTo understand variance, one must first understand something about other measures of dispersion. One measure of dispersion is the \"average of deviations.\" This value is equal to the average, for a set of numbers, of the differences between each number and the set's mean. The mean (also known as the average) is simply the sum of the numbers in a given set divided by the number of entries in the set. For the set of eight test scores: 7 + 25 + 36 + 44 + 59 + 71 + 85 + 97, the mean is 53. The deviation from the mean for any given value is that value minus the value of the mean. For example, the first number in the set, 7, has a deviation from the mean of -46; the second number, 25, has a deviation from the mean of -28; and so on. However, the sum of these deviations across the entire data set will be equal to 0 (since by definition the mean is the \"middle\" value with all other values being above or below it.) A measure that will show how much deviation is involved without having these deviations add up to zero would be more useful in evaluating data. Such a nonzero sum can be obtained by adding the absolute values of the deviations. This average is the absolute mean deviation. However, for reasons that will not be dealt with here, even this expression has limited application.\nTheoretically, the value of σ2 should relate valuable information regarding the spread of data. However, in order for this concept to be applied in practical situations (we cannot talk about squared test scores) we may elect to use the square root of the variance. This value is called the standard deviation of the scores. For this series of test scores the standard deviation is the square root of 825.38 or 28.73. In general, a small standard deviation indicates that the data are clustered closely around the mean; a large standard deviation shows that the data are more spread apart.\nWhile modern computerization reduces the need for laborious statistical calculations, it is still necessary to understand and interpret the concept of variance and its daughter, standard deviation, in order to digest the statistical significance of data. For example, teachers must be thoroughly familiar with these statistical tools in order to properly interpret test data.\nSee also Set theory; Statistics.\nDunham, William. Journey Through Genius.

FORD and Thomas L. Johnson.\nNo. 91-779.\nArgued April 20, 1992.\nDecided June 12, 1992.\n\n\nSyllabus\n\nRespondents sued petitioner, their employer, under the Federal Employers' Liability Act in the state court in Yellowstone County, Montana.  That court denied petitioner's motions to change venue to Hill County, where petitioner claimed to have its principal place of business in Montana.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, ruling that Montana's venue rules—which permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against a corporation, like petitioner, that is incorporated elsewhere—do not work a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\nHeld:  The distinction in treatment contained in Montana's venue rules does not offend the Equal Protection Clause.  Those rules neither deprive petitioner of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion, and are valid because they can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest:  adjustment of the disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial.  Montana could reasonably determine that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating in the county of its home office outweighs a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice. Petitioner has not shown that the Montana venue rules' hinging on State of incorporation rather than domicile makes them so under- or overinclusive as to be irrational.  Besides, petitioner, being domiciled outside Montana, would not benefit from a rule turning on domicile, and therefore cannot complain of a rule hinging on State of incorporation.  Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U.S. 490, 47 S.Ct. 678, 71 L.Ed. 1165, distinguished.  Pp. 2185-2188.\n--- Mont. ----, 819 P.2d 169 (1991), affirmed.\nSOUTER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\nBetty Jo Christian, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\nJoel I. Klein, Washington, D.C., for respondents.\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n\n1\nMontana's venue rules permit a plaintiff to sue a corporation incorporated in that State only in the county of its principal place of business, but permit suit in any county against a corporation incorporated elsewhere.  This case presents the question whether the distinction in treatment offends the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. Amdt. 14, § 1.  We hold that it does not.\n\n\n2\nRespondents William D. Ford and Thomas L. Johnson were employed by petitioner Burlington Northern Railroad Company, a corporation owing its existence to the laws of Delaware and having a principal place of business in Fort Worth, Texas.  Ford and Johnson raised a claim under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51-60, and brought suit in the state trial court for Yellowstone County, Montana, alleging injuries sustained while working at Burlington's premises in Sheridan, Wyoming.  In each case, Burlington moved to change venue to Hill County, Montana, where it claimed to have its principal place of business in that State.  The trial court denied each motion, and Burlington brought interlocutory appeals.\n\n\n3\nThe Supreme Court of Montana consolidated the two cases and affirmed the decisions of the trial court.  --- Mont. ----, 819 P.2d 169 (1991).  Under the Montana venue rules, the court said, a foreign corporation may be sued in any of Montana's counties. Id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 171.  The court rejected Burlington's argument that the State's venue rules worked a discrimination violating the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The Montana venue rules, the court explained, were subject merely to rational-basis review, id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 173, which was satisfied, at least in these cases, by the consonance of the rules with federal policy, embodied in FELA, of facilitating recovery by injured railroad workers, id., at ---- - ----, 819 P.2d, at 173-174.  Besides, the court said, Montana's venue rules did not even discriminate against Burlington, since Ford and Johnson could have sued the corporation in the Federal District Court for Montana, which sits in Yellowstone County, among other places. Id., at ----, 819 P.2d, at 175.  We granted certiorari, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 964, 117 L.Ed.2d 130 (1992), and, although our reasoning differs from that of the State Supreme Court, now affirm.*\n\n\n4\nA Montana statute provides that \"the proper place of trial for all civil actions is the county in which the defendants or any of them may reside at the commencement of the action.\"  Mont.Code Ann. § 25-2-118(1) (1991).  But, \"if none of the defendants reside in the state, the proper place of trial is any county the plaintiff designates in the complaint.\"  § 25-2-118(2).  The Supreme Court of Montana has long held that a corporation does not \"reside in the state\" for venue purposes unless Montana is its State of incorporation, see, e.g., Haug v. Burlington Northern R. Co., 236 Mont. 368, 371, 770 P.2d 517, 519 (1989);  Foley v. General Motors Corp., 159 Mont. 469, 472-473, 499 P.2d 774, 776 (1972);  Hanlon v. Great Northern R. Co., 83 Mont. 15, 21, 268 P. 547, 549 (1928);  Pue v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 78 Mont. 40, 43, 252 P. 313, 315 (1926), and that a Montana corporation resides in the Montana county in which it has its principal place of business, see, e.g., Mapston v. Joint School District No. 8, 227 Mont. 521, 523, 740 P.2d 676, 677 (1987);  Platt v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 222 Mont. 184, 187, 721 P.2d 336, 338 (1986).  In combination, these venue rules, with exceptions not here relevant, permit a plaintiff to sue a domestic company in just the one county where it has its principal place of business, while a plaintiff may sue a foreign corporation in any of the State's 56 counties.  Burlington claims the distinction offends the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n\n5\nThe Fourteenth Amendment forbids a State to \"deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1.  Because the Montana venue rules neither deprive Burlington of a fundamental right nor classify along suspect lines like race or religion, they do not deny equal protection to Burlington unless they fail in rationally furthering legitimate state ends.  See, e.g., United States v. Sperry Corp., 493 U.S. 52, 64, 110 S.Ct. 387, 396, 107 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989); Dallas v. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18 (1989).\n\n\n6\nVenue rules generally reflect equity or expediency in resolving disparate interests of parties to a lawsuit in the place of trial.  See, e.g., Citizens & Southern National Bank v. Bougas, 434 U.S. 35, 44, n. 10, 98 S.Ct. 88, 94, n. 10, 54 L.Ed.2d 218 (1977);  Denver & R.G.W.R. Co. v. Trainmen, 387 U.S. 556, 560, 87 S.Ct. 1746, 1748, 18 L.Ed.2d 954 (1967);  Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612, 623, 84 S.Ct. 805, 812, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964);  F. James & G. Hazard, Civil Procedure 47 (3d ed. 1985).  The forum preferable to one party may be undesirable to another, and the adjustment of such warring interests is a valid state concern. Cf. United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 178, 101 S.Ct. 453, 461, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980).  In striking the balance between them, a State may have a number of choices, any of which would survive scrutiny, each of them passable under the standard tolerating some play in the joints of governmental machinery.  See Bain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson, 282 U.S. 499, 501, 51 S.Ct. 228, 229, 75 L.Ed. 482 (1931).  Thus, we have no doubt that a State would act within its constitutional prerogatives if it were to give so much weight to the interests of plaintiffs as to allow them to sue in the counties of their choice under all circumstances.  It is equally clear that a State might temper such an \"any county\" rule to the extent a reasonable assessment of defendants' interests so justified.\n\n\n7\nHere, Montana has decided that the any-county rule should give way to a single-county rule where a defendant resides in Montana, arguably on the reasonable ground that a defendant should not be subjected to a plaintiff's tactical advantage of forcing a trial far from the defendant's residence.  At the same time, Montana has weighed the interest of a defendant who does not reside in Montana differently, arguably on the equally reasonable ground that for most nonresident defendants the inconvenience will be great whether they have to defend in, say, Billings or Havre. See Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, 274 U.S. 490, 498, 47 S.Ct. 678, 681, 71 L.Ed. 1165 (1927) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Montana could thus have decided that a nonresident defendant's interest in convenience is too slight to outweigh the plaintiff's interest in suing in the forum of his choice.\n\n\n8\nBurlington does not, indeed, seriously contend that such a decision is constitutionally flawed as applied to individual nonresident defendants.  Nor does it argue that such a rule is unconstitutional even when applied to corporate defendants without a fixed place of business in Montana.  Burlington does claim, however, that the rule is unconstitutional as applied to a corporate defendant like Burlington that not only has its home office in some other State or country, but also has a place of business in Montana that would qualify as its \"principal place of business\" if it were a Montana corporation.\n\n\n9\nBurlington's claim fails.  Montana could reasonably have determined that a corporate defendant's home office is generally of greater significance to the corporation's convenience in litigation than its other offices;  that foreign corporations are unlikely to have their principal offices in Montana;  and that Montana's domestic corporations will probably keep headquarters within the State.  We cannot say, at least not on this record, that any of these assumptions is irrational.  Cf. G.D. Searle & Co. v. Cohn, 455 U.S. 404, 410, 102 S.Ct. 1137, 1142, 71 L.Ed.2d 250 (1982);  Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U.S. 580, 585, 55 S.Ct. 538, 540, 79 L.Ed. 1070 (1935).  And upon them Montana may have premised the policy judgment, which we find constitutionally unimpeachable, that only the convenience to a corporate defendant of litigating in the county containing its home office is sufficiently significant to outweigh a plaintiff's interest in suing in the county of his choice.\n\n\n10\nOf course Montana's venue rules would have implemented that policy judgment with greater precision if they had turned on the location of a corporate defendant's principal place of business, not on its State of incorporation.  But this is hardly enough to make the rules fail rational-basis review, for \"rational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.\"  New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S. 297, 303, 96 S.Ct. 2513, 2517, 49 L.Ed.2d 511 (1976);  see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 814, 96 S.Ct. 2488, 2500, 49 L.Ed.2d 220 (1976);  Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U.S. 61, 78, 31 S.Ct. 337, 340, 55 L.Ed. 369 (1911).  Montana may reasonably have thought that the location of a corporate defendant's principal place of business would not be as readily verifiable as its State of incorporation, that a rule hinging on the former would invite wasteful side shows of venue litigation, and that obviating the side shows would be worth the loss in precision.  These possibilities, of course, put Burlington a far cry away from the point of discharging its burden of showing that the under- and overinclusiveness of Montana's venue rules is so great that the rules can no longer be said rationally to implement Montana's policy judgment.  See, e.g., Brownell, supra, 294 U.S., at 584, 55 S.Ct., at 540.  Besides, Burlington, having headquarters elsewhere, would not benefit even from a scheme based on domicile, and is therefore in no position to complain of Montana's using State of incorporation as a surrogate for domicile.  See Roberts & Schaefer Co. v. Emmerson, 271 U.S. 50, 53-55, 46 S.Ct. 375, 376-377, 70 L.Ed. 827 (1926);  cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 522, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960).\n\n\n11\nBurlington is left with the argument that Power Manufacturing Co. v. Saunders, supra, controls this case.  But it does not.  In Saunders, we considered Arkansas' venue rules, which restricted suit against a domestic corporation to those counties where it maintained a place of business, 274 U.S., at 491-492, 47 S.Ct., at 678-679, but exposed foreign corporations to suit in any county, id., at 492, 47 S.Ct., at 679.  We held that the distinction lacked a rational basis and therefore deprived foreign corporate defendants of the equal protection of the laws.  Id., at 494, 47 S.Ct., at 679.  The statutory provision challenged in Saunders, however, applied only to foreign corporations authorized to do business in Arkansas, ibid., so that most of the corporations subject to its any-county rule probably had a place of business in Arkansas.  In contrast, most of the corporations subject to Montana's any-county rule probably do not have their principal place of business in Montana.  Thus, Arkansas' special rule for foreign corporations was tailored with significantly less precision than Montana's, and, on the assumption that Saunders is still good law, see American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Starnes, 425 U.S. 637, 645, n. 6, 96 S.Ct. 1800, 1805, n. 6, 48 L.Ed.2d 263 (1976), its holding does not invalidate Montana's venue rules.\n\n\n12\nIn sum, Montana's venue rules can be understood as rationally furthering a legitimate state interest.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Montana is accordingly\n\n\n13\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n*\n The decision below is final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1257(a).  See American Motorists Ins. Co. v.

For each tuple, it prints a formatted string to the console. The `name` value is obtained in the same way as in the first section, by removing the prefix \"weather-\" from the value of the `name` variable.

The problem is the characters are completely dysfunctional and wackiness ensues. On the outside, they look like a group of friends and colleagues, but it's not like that at all.\n\n [directions]\nBreaking the Idea Down\nSome ideas sound good on paper, but when scrutinized for effective character dynamics etc. are vague or limited. Boil your notes down, what are the idea’s elements?\n\nThe motif of “school friends, back in the day, causing trouble” might continually crop up if you read a lot of scripts. But that’s not a TV show idea in and of itself. For example, is it a coming-of-age comedy with bullies and crushes? Or a tragedy of nascent criminality with cops and gangsters? – “It’s like, nostalgia and cracking jokes”.\n\nIt’s too vague and limited to justify a series is what it is.\n\nSuch a note may well inspire a good TV show idea. But before developing it, it should already have a strong indication of:\n\nCentral character dynamics\nIrony\nTone and/or genre\nStakes\nSetting/World\nObstacles\nAlso, consider whether or not the idea is right for you. Perhaps during your brainstorming, a brilliant action premise has revealed itself. But if you write feel-good comedy and action bores you then maybe that’s an idea for someone else. Alternatively, you could find a way to combine your style with the idea, if possible.\n\nDeveloping a Brilliant TV Show Idea \nCommunity TV Show Idea\nCommunity\nTo go into actual development the idea must have a successful pitch. (Pitches and treatments are an art in themselves -check out our article for creating a movie pitch and tv pitch for that stage).\n\nBefore this though, naturally, you’ll develop the idea yourself:\n\nMore than being harsh, you now need to aggressively pick holes in your idea. Whoever you’re pitching to will do this, so you might as well be ready.\n\nPretend that you hate the idea. How would you construct an argument against it? You’ll probably never craft a totally bulletproof show- but attempting to is essential.\n\n“… A good screenwriter, especially anyone writing on spec, has to think about everyone all down the line, from the agent to the producer to the studio head to the public”\n\nBlake Snyder\nFind other creatives, ideally professionals, with who you can discuss your idea at length. Walk them through an episode; welcome interruptions, new ideas and opinions.\n\nIt’s easy to get defensive or possessive of an idea. But remember that TV is a medium of mass communication. And as such, development is often a communicative process.\n\nYou probably haven’t seen every TV show. So if you can’t find other professionals, a TV buff will be a lot better than nothing.\n\nIn development, these are the kinds of questions that need to be answered:\n\nWhat Happens in Episode Thirty-Two?\nAs previously stated, story longevity is paramount for TV; especially if the idea is in sitcom or soap territory. Will the idea’s conflict regenerate without feeling repetitive? And what will the typical structure of each episode look like – this is where some degree of repetition is essential.\n\nIs There Irony?\nBrilliant TV ideas tend to have a strong sense of irony. For example, Buffy is a blonde high school girl killing vampires, David Brent forgoes work to be mates with everyone, but doesn’t know he’s a dick. Whilst in Teachers the staff are worse than the students.\n\nNovelty?\nLiving in the age of content cuts both ways. Whilst there’s room for risk because streaming services are less regulated and try to outdo each other by picking up originals, there’s also a feeling that everything’s been done.\n\nIs your style fresh, if your core concept isn’t? Russian Doll, for example, is a stunning reinvention of the idea behind Groundhog Day. And since its success, unique time loop premises keep cropping up.\n\nBrilliant Characters and Dynamics?\nAll stories need at least one outstanding subject around whom dynamics with the world and other characters are built. With TV, you’re asking the audience to invite these personalities into their living rooms every week.\n\nMoreover, you’re asking them to invite your characters rather than any others from the wealth banging on the door.

Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking and 20 gallons per shower. He wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?\n[Answer]First find the total volume of the pool: 10 feet * 10 feet * 6 feet = 600 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons he needs to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water from the total amount of water Jerry is allowed to use: 1000 gallons - 600 gallons - 100 gallons = 300 gallons. Then divide the amount of water Jerry has left to use for showers by the amount of water per shower to find how many showers he can take: 300 gallons / 20 gallons / shower = 15 showers. The answer is 15.\n\n[Question]Alissa used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold 5 pieces of letter-size paper 3 times then cut along the edges to form smaller note papers. She would then stack these smaller note papers and staple them together. How long would 1 notepad last if someone wrote 10 notes per day?\n[Answer]Alissa folding it 3 times makes 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 pieces of note - size paper per letter - size paper. So 5 pieces of letter - size paper make 5 × 8 = 40 pieces of note - size paper. 1 note pad would last 40 ÷ 10 = 4 days if someone wrote 10 notes a day. The answer is 4.\n\n[Question]Mary earns $20 washing cars and $40 walking dogs each month. If she puts half of that money away each month how long would it take her to save $150?\n[Answer]Each month she makes 20 + 40 = $60. Every month she saves 60 / 2 = $30. To save $150 it will take her 150 / 30 = 5 months. The answer is 5.\n\n[Question]Val cuts a single watermelon into 40 slices, and each slice has 20 black seeds and 20 white seeds.

With an overwhelming amount of data available to global marketers to help guide everything from product development to digital communication strategies, the trick lies in leveraging this abundance of information to your advantage.\nAhead of his talk at the International Search Summit in San Jose in less than two weeks’ time, Jeremiah Andrick of Logitech shares a few insights into how and why data is an absolutely vital component in the shaping of the company’s global marketing strategy.\nWhat do you most enjoy about working in international Search?\nTwo Reasons: One, I love the problem space as it is so much more complex than just a single country Search program. US centric Search has one set of problems that is constantly changing, but when you go international not only does the problem space get a lot larger, determining how to scale your Search program gets harder. I love the challenge of that complexity. Second reason is that it exposes me to different cultures and how they view our products and services. I love the aspect of language and the consumer journey.\nI think the greatest challenges exist in the flexibility of your CMS. To scale we tend to take the US/english version of a site and just duplicate it. Our content management systems tend to put us in that box, when success may start with a global rollout of the fundamentals, but with significant changes in IA, Content and maybe even approach. So building flexibility over time to your CMS is part one. Part two is building an IA that makes sense for the audiences that you serve. After that it becomes a bit like every other program. How do you define success in each region/country/audience you work with? Do you have content that supports those goals, etc. etc.\nThe big fundamental that is often overlooked though is how you tie all this together which is with Data. Do you have the tools to know how you are doing and are you measuring things the right way to justify the efforts.\nWhich markets do you find particularly challenging or interesting to target? And why?\nI know the right answer to this question should be Asia, but I am personally interested in Latin America. Often one challenge for SEOs is the misidentification of French or English content, but the problem seems even more complex when you look at spanish regions. The variations are subtle to a non-native speaker in one of those countries but important and the search engines don’t seem to do a great job of telling things apart without strong signals from Domain or other areas. This is a space that if you know how to adapt to could be profitable.\nYou’ve been working on making Logitech’s international presence responsive. What impact has mobile on your global activities and strategies?\nSo at Logitech we think a lot about the customer journey, we leverage lots of data, surveys and look and NPS analysis to try and create compelling and useful products. The website is no different, it is a product of our company and we look at the customer journey with same level of detail on concern. As mobile usage has gone up (we all knew it would) we don’t want to focus on redesign as a novel activity, creating a mobile experience as tactic but as a part of our larger goal of attracting and retaining customers. Users on mobile devices have different attention spans, different levels of patience. Testing to get the experience right is critical. As we consider and move forward we are thinking first about the content and the experience, second about the impacts on search. We believe if we get the first right the second will follow.\nISS has some of the best speakers at any event, people who work in the trenches. There is honest, open discussion and the chance to ask real questions.
