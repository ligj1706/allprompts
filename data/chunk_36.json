Momentum transfer and the mixing layer. Distribution of radiation in plant canopies, and measurement of canopy structure. Concepts in evapo-transpiration like equilibrium and decoupling. Isohydric and anisohydric control.\n\nThe labs will give hands-on experience with data collection equipment for measuring temperature, humidity, wind, radiation and crop water use. Advanced measurement systems, and building sensors.\n\nProjects include measurement and data collection, analysis of data series from the field and lab. Two large projects, one on evapo-transpiration models, and the second on trunk sap flow measurement.\n\nThe grade will be derived from lab reports, project reports and an exam.\n\nCourse/Module aims:\nThis course supplements the basic course in agricultural meteorology. It gives a basic understanding of the measurements methods and equipment in that field.
