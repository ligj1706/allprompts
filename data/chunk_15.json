The problem is the characters are completely dysfunctional and wackiness ensues. On the outside, they look like a group of friends and colleagues, but it's not like that at all.\n\n [directions]\nBreaking the Idea Down\nSome ideas sound good on paper, but when scrutinized for effective character dynamics etc. are vague or limited. Boil your notes down, what are the idea’s elements?\n\nThe motif of “school friends, back in the day, causing trouble” might continually crop up if you read a lot of scripts. But that’s not a TV show idea in and of itself. For example, is it a coming-of-age comedy with bullies and crushes? Or a tragedy of nascent criminality with cops and gangsters? – “It’s like, nostalgia and cracking jokes”.\n\nIt’s too vague and limited to justify a series is what it is.\n\nSuch a note may well inspire a good TV show idea. But before developing it, it should already have a strong indication of:\n\nCentral character dynamics\nIrony\nTone and/or genre\nStakes\nSetting/World\nObstacles\nAlso, consider whether or not the idea is right for you. Perhaps during your brainstorming, a brilliant action premise has revealed itself. But if you write feel-good comedy and action bores you then maybe that’s an idea for someone else. Alternatively, you could find a way to combine your style with the idea, if possible.\n\nDeveloping a Brilliant TV Show Idea \nCommunity TV Show Idea\nCommunity\nTo go into actual development the idea must have a successful pitch. (Pitches and treatments are an art in themselves -check out our article for creating a movie pitch and tv pitch for that stage).\n\nBefore this though, naturally, you’ll develop the idea yourself:\n\nMore than being harsh, you now need to aggressively pick holes in your idea. Whoever you’re pitching to will do this, so you might as well be ready.\n\nPretend that you hate the idea. How would you construct an argument against it? You’ll probably never craft a totally bulletproof show- but attempting to is essential.\n\n“… A good screenwriter, especially anyone writing on spec, has to think about everyone all down the line, from the agent to the producer to the studio head to the public”\n\nBlake Snyder\nFind other creatives, ideally professionals, with who you can discuss your idea at length. Walk them through an episode; welcome interruptions, new ideas and opinions.\n\nIt’s easy to get defensive or possessive of an idea. But remember that TV is a medium of mass communication. And as such, development is often a communicative process.\n\nYou probably haven’t seen every TV show. So if you can’t find other professionals, a TV buff will be a lot better than nothing.\n\nIn development, these are the kinds of questions that need to be answered:\n\nWhat Happens in Episode Thirty-Two?\nAs previously stated, story longevity is paramount for TV; especially if the idea is in sitcom or soap territory. Will the idea’s conflict regenerate without feeling repetitive? And what will the typical structure of each episode look like – this is where some degree of repetition is essential.\n\nIs There Irony?\nBrilliant TV ideas tend to have a strong sense of irony. For example, Buffy is a blonde high school girl killing vampires, David Brent forgoes work to be mates with everyone, but doesn’t know he’s a dick. Whilst in Teachers the staff are worse than the students.\n\nNovelty?\nLiving in the age of content cuts both ways. Whilst there’s room for risk because streaming services are less regulated and try to outdo each other by picking up originals, there’s also a feeling that everything’s been done.\n\nIs your style fresh, if your core concept isn’t? Russian Doll, for example, is a stunning reinvention of the idea behind Groundhog Day. And since its success, unique time loop premises keep cropping up.\n\nBrilliant Characters and Dynamics?\nAll stories need at least one outstanding subject around whom dynamics with the world and other characters are built. With TV, you’re asking the audience to invite these personalities into their living rooms every week.\n\nMoreover, you’re asking them to invite your characters rather than any others from the wealth banging on the door.

Of the 16 fish – 6 were eaten – 2 were returned to the store = 8 fish. After he returned the fish to the store, he exchanged them for 3 new fish + 8 fish that were left = 11 fish now in his tank.\nThe answer: 11\nReverse engineering the question: Jonah decided to set up an aquarium.

How many fish does Jonah have now?\n\n\nReasoning and answer: Since the number of oranges that Martin has now is twice the number of limes, there are 50 / 2 = 25 limes. The number of fruits she has now is 50 oranges + 25 limes = 75.

Thus, Freddy is 11 + 4 = 15 years old.\nThe answer: 15\nWhat was the question?\nQuestion: Cynthia has three children whose ages add up to 35.
