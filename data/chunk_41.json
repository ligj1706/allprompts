Now, at 42, she's made fighting to end hateful dialogue her personal crusade. Speaking around the world on the issue (including a TED talk that has 6 million views), she stopped to talk to Glamour about what it will really take to change the virtual culture.\nOne Woman, Standing Up for Others: \"We may never fully stomp out hurtful online behavior,\" says Lewinsky. \"But I do believe we can get to a place where it's rarer and less harmful, specifically that a bully's words are drowned out by more supportive voices.\"\nGlamour: In our survey one out of five women admitted to criticizing a celebrity online. Is that disturbing to you?\nMonica Lewinsky: Constructive criticism is legitimate, but when it escalates to vitriol, it affects us all, because celebrities and influencers are part of the collective consciousness. Women need to support other women, not cut them down. And that goes for recognizable women too.\nGlamour: So how can women distinguish between criticizing and bullying?\nGlamour: Our survey also found that 57 percent of women reported receiving negative comments. Is Internet shaming the price of living in the fully wired 21st century?\nML: Acceptance of and adaptation to this deplorable behavior is not an option. Full stop. But as painful and destructive as they are, the hateful comments allow us to map the underlying beliefs of many people in a way we've never been able to before. It's almost as if all of the negativity and misogyny needs to come to the surface so we can fully understand what it is, and how deep it goes, before we can begin to shift it. Of course, I wish it weren't there.\nGlamour: So many women—even the most confident or accomplished—feel ashamed when we are confronted by cruel comments or critiques online. What advice would you give them?\nML: The first and most important thing sounds easy but can be challenging to do when we feel vulnerable: Reach out to someone—a friend, a relative, a mentor, or a professional—and share what happened. One reason I'm working with Bystander Revolution is precisely because it offers help in these situations. Feeling alone and unseen can intensify the experience of being harassed, shamed, or bullied. Also, if you can—and believe me, I know this is asking a lot—try and have neutral compassion toward the perpetrator. Step outside the sting of the incident and realize that this person is trying to erase their own inadequacy or unhappiness by transferring it to you. It won't make the incident go away, but it's one thing you can do to reduce the pain.\nGlamour: What can we all do to make the Internet a better place?\nML: The most potent thing we can do is to bring more compassion online. When you see anyone being targeted, support her or him with a positive comment or emoji. Be mindful of clickbait—sensational stories designed to humiliate.

But there are a smaller set of initiatives that represent big investment areas in 2022 to accelerate progress. These are outlined below, and will be how we communicate our priorities going forward:\n\nMake Reels successful. It’s critical to ensure people have great ways to create content and express themselves. Today’s genre of public short-form video opens up new ways for people to create and discover content. While Facebook’s discovery engine is designed to support many different formats (text, photos, video, and eventually Metaverse experiences), our biggest gap today is around short-form video and that’s why we’re focused on integrating Reels in Home, Watch, IFR, and Groups.\nBuild world-class recommendations technology. While we frequently talk about products people can see and use, the quality of what’s under the hood powering these experiences is more important than ever. Building a world-class recommendations system that is responsive to your interests, can identify trending content and original creators, and makes responsible recommendations while evaluating billions of pieces of content produced across Meta is an incredibly challenging technical problem. It’s a different problem than ranking the top content from the people, groups, or businesses you’re connected to and requires state-of-the-art technical innovation to succeed. We’re investing heavily in our Modern Recommendation Systems initiative with partners across the company to accelerate our work here.\nUnlock messaging-based sharing. Messaging apps have become an important venue for people to share and have conversations with smaller groups of friends and sub-communities. We’re also seeing shifts away from resharing content broadly via Feed and towards resharing content to smaller audiences in messaging apps. Given how much sharing and social interactions take place on messaging apps, it’s important that we integrate messaging experiences more fundamentally into how we enable people to connect and share on Facebook. To that end, we’re partnering with the Messenger team to enable an integrated inbox for more people on Facebook, revamping our sharing flows to enable better sharing to messaging apps across the board, and building community messaging experiences across Facebook and Messenger.\nWhile the efforts above are called out as priorities, it does not mean that other work across the organization isn’t important. Advancing all pillars of our strategy, ensuring Facebook is safe and enjoyable, supporting our revenue and engagement goals, and contributing to the broader set of Meta-level priorities require a strong portfolio of work across our organization. The reason the priorities above are highlighted is that these efforts represent the near-term, high-lift investments that we must accelerate to unlock foundational changes to how people will use Facebook over the next few years. They also represent some of the biggest - but also most challenging - opportunities for us to succeed with Young Adults. As top product priorities, we’ll communicate regularly about these and ensure that these areas and their dependencies receive the level of focus and investment required to succeed.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that in January we shared an aspiration to approach building products that are “Trustworthy,” “People-Centric,” and “Unified.” Rather than call these out as a discrete product priority, I want to emphasize that these are values we want to infuse into everything we build as part of the cultural change we’re making throughout the organization. I’ll continue to advocate for and highlight progress here across all of our teams.\nWhat's the conclusion?"}, {"id": 6160, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "generate medical surgery technobabble"}, {"id": 6161, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a poem about summer, specifically the smell of clean air, the feeling of birth and new chances in life and connecting it with appreciation to mothers.

A cline is a region where two color morphs of one species arrange themselves at opposite ends of an environmental gradient, with increasing mixtures occurring between. Such a cline exists near Liverpool, England, where a dark morph of a local moth has flourished in response to the blackening of tree trunks by air pollution from the mills. The moths are nocturnal, resting during the day on tree trunks, where their coloration acts as camouflage against predatory birds. In Liverpool, where tree trunks are blackened by smoke, a high percentage of moths are dark morph.

Make the language more polished and break into sections for better readability: I want to share the experience I had at Stanford Health so that others can take into condersation when making decisions about where to get spinal surgery done. Though I was happy with the surgeon, and surgical results, my experience for 5 days at Stanford Health where I never placed in a room or received specalized care was far from what I anticpated from a healthcare organization of Stanford’s stature. \n\nHaving had previous spinal fusions for scoliosis, I sort of know the drill. Upon meeting with several providers, I decided that Stanford would be the best fit for my needs especially since their website advertises that every patient gets a private room. When I had my first two surgeries, just over twenty years ago, I recall the post-op pain, physical therapy, lack of privacy (I had a shared room then) and so fourth being some of the obstables one has to face whlie in excuritating pain. Stanford claims they have wonderful patient care and getting a room was a given. I was wrong. \n\nI had surgery in late-November and while the procedure went well and I think the surgeon is amazing, the aftercare has left me still feeling anxious. I reached out to Stanford a week ago and haven’t heard back so I feel like it’s best to share my story more publicly.\n\nMy surgery was 8 hours and afterwards, I was placed in PACU (not totally unusual). I was told numerous times that they were trying to get a room for me as they knew I would be there for at least four nights. We asked every person who came behind the curtain that was the space where I was staying—contacted the doctors team—to no avail. I was left in PACU for four nights after having T10-Pelvis spinal fusion. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. \n\n1. PACU nurses aren’t trained on how to help individuals get out of a bed post-spine surgery. I had to explain how to log roll 9 out of 10 times and nurse came in. It got to the point that I would not call for assistance to use the bathroom because either the individual would put my bed into a “seating position” or they would take too long to come. \n2. PACU is for short-term stays. Staff do not discuss the needs of the patients there (i.e. when they’re switching shifts) so you are constantly asked the same quesitons over-and-over-and-over again i.e. “do you need to wear your brace when you go to the bathroom” (the answer is no, it was for PT to size it). \n3. The sheets were never changed during the four nights I was there\n4. My partner had to ask several times when I would go to the bathroom for someone to change my undermat as it was covered in blood from my incision pumps \n5. The pumps were not emptied regulary and would oventimes be full so I would ooze out onto my dressing gown \n6. They only changed my gown twice even though there was blood on it constantly \n7. Pain mangement was not explained thoroughly to me, I thought I only had two options. One gave me migraines, the other nausea so then I would chase down the symptoms with other medications. It was not until a nurse on the four night told me that there are numerous options that I was finally able to dial in what was best for me. \n\nWhile I understand that we live in a different world post-COVID, I do think this could have been handled better and not having an available over the span of 4 nights seems ridiculous. Instead of allowing me to move my location, I was told that they were canceling surgeries and I was lucky because people where in hallways. Whlie I didn’t see these poor patients, I doubt any of them had such a prodecure and a cathather which was prompty removed after a few hours and a surgery leaving them unable to walk to the bathroom. \n\nHaving experienced this, previous insight would have helped me making a decision regarding which hospital to use to help support me after such an intensive surgery."}, {"id": 6226, "actor": "Technology & Astrology", "prompt": "If Tetris pieces were people, what would their Zodiac signs would be?"}, {"id": 6227, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "Write a short story set in the world of Harry Potter, but Harry is a Leninist revolutionary waging class war against reactionary wizarding society."}, {"id": 6228, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "Bash line to recursively delete all folders called validation"}, {"id": 6229, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a full cute love story between a boy vampire named Adrian and a boy ghost named Leo about how hard the after life is with a happy ending and a kiss."}, {"id": 6230, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "Premise: \"A professional photographer is taking photos of possible newly discovered herbal medicines while talking to a local inhabitant.\"\nHypothesis: \"A person is taking photos for their business.\"\nIs the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\nOptions:\n- yes\n- it is not possible to tell\n- no Stream of thoughts:"}, {"id": 6231, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "Cats meow?"}, {"id": 6232, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "Can you describe the process and challenges of deep sea exploration and its significance for scientific research?"}, {"id": 6233, "actor": "Sustainable Packaging & Skin Care Products", "prompt": "Please write me a detailed description about the brand CTEK."}, {"id": 6234, "actor": "Entertainment & Politics", "prompt": "it's supposed to go like this:\n\n\"Too many requests in 1 hour.

To handle these exceptions gracefully, the application requires an emergency buffer that can be dynamically allocated whenever needed.\n\nYour task is to implement three functions: `alloc_emergency_exception_buf()`, `const()`, and `heap_lock()`.\n\n1. `alloc_emergency_exception_buf()`: This function should allocate an emergency buffer of sufficient size to hold exception information whenever an exceptional condition occurs. The size of the buffer should be determined based on the specific requirements of the application, which are beyond the scope of this task. You can assume that this function will be called only when there is sufficient memory available.\n\n2. `const()`: This function should return a constant value that can be used by the application to check if an emergency buffer has been allocated. The value returned by this function should remain constant throughout the execution of the program.\n\n3. `heap_lock()`: This function should lock the heap to prevent any other allocations or deallocations from occurring while an emergency buffer is being allocated. This will ensure the atomicity of the buffer allocation process. Once the buffer is allocated, the heap can be unlocked.\n\nYou need to implement these three functions in any programming language of your choice.\n\nNote:\n\n- The `alloc_emergency_exception_buf()` function should not return anything.\n- The `const()` function should not have any parameters and should return an integer value.\n- The `heap_lock()` function should not have any parameters and should not return anything.\n\nWrite the three functions in the language of your choice and test them with suitable inputs."}, {"id": 6267, "actor": "String Manipulation & Data Structures", "prompt": "As a teacher, you are tasked with creating a comprehensive learning plan that not only covers the core curriculum but also includes additional learning goals such as problem-solving and critical thinking skills.
