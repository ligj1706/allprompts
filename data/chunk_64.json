HOG is an effective feature descriptor that captures the shape and edge information of an image.\n\nWrite a function `calculate_hog(image)` that takes an input grayscale image and returns the HOG representation of the image.\n\nTo calculate the HOG of an image, follow these steps:\n\n1. Divide the image into small regions called cells. Each cell represents a fixed size block of pixels.\n2. For each cell, calculate the gradient magnitude and orientation. The gradient magnitude represents the intensity of the change in pixel values, while the gradient orientation represents the direction of the change.\n3. Group several cells together to form a block. A block contains multiple cells and is used to normalize the HOG representation.\n4. For each block, concatenate the gradient magnitudes of the cells within the block. This forms the HOG representation of the block.\n5. Repeat the previous step for all blocks in the image to obtain the final HOG representation.\n\nThe function should use the following parameters for calculating the HOG representation:\n- `orientations`: The number of orientation bins to use for calculating the gradients.\n- `pixels_per_cell`: The size of the cells in pixels.\n- `cells_per_block`: The number of cells to group together to form a block.\n- `block_norm`: The normalization method to apply to each block.\n\nAfter calculating the HOG representation, display the original grayscale image and the resulting HOG image side by side.\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nimage = load_grayscale_image(\"path/to/image.jpg\")\nhog_image = calculate_hog(image)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12,9), subplot_kw=dict(xticks=[], yticks=[]))\n\nax[0].imshow(image)\nax[0].set_title(\"Original Image\")\nax[1].imshow(hog_image)\nax[1].set_title(\"HOG Image\")\n\nplt.show()\n```"}, {"id": 9649, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a function `linear_search` that takes in a list `l` and an integer `target`. \n\nThe `linear_search` function is used to find the index of the first occurrence of the `target` in the given list.

Learn how your app can access Genius's content and community this easily too!\nAdd Genius Annotations To Your Own Site\n\nIn addition to interacting with Genius annotations through the API, it's easy to make any page annotatable and display annotations you've created on it. Just add the script tag:\n\nRegistering Your Application\nFirst, visit the Genius API Client management page and create an API client for your application. This will provide you with a client\\_id and a client\\_secret that you'll use to identify your application to Genius. The redirect\\_uri is used for authenticating Genius users with your application. You can change it later. The API Client will belong to the user account signed in to Genius when it's created.\n\nMaking Requests\nThe available endpoints are listed below in the resources section, along with embedded examples showing how they work and what they return.\n\nGenius uses OAuth2 for authentication. All API requests must be authenticated. There are plenty of libraries available to help with this part of your integration. There's also a detailed guide below if you're committed to implementing it yourself.\n\nResources\nAnnotations\nAn annotation is a piece of content about a part of a document. The document may be a song (hosted on Genius) or a web page (hosted anywhere). The part of a document that an annotation is attached to is called a referent.\n\nAnnotation data returned from the API includes both the substance of the annotation and the necessary information for displaying it in its original context.\n\napi.genius.com/\nannotations/10225840\n Authorization: Bearer\nAccess Token\nSee details about using an access token in the authentication section below.\n \nGET /annotations/:id\nData for a specific annotation.\n\nid ID of the annotation\n10225840\ntext\\_format Format for text bodies related to the document.

Each referent is associated with a web page or a song and may have one or more annotations. Referents can be searched by the document they are attached to or by the user that created them.\n\nWhen a new annotation is created either a referent is created with it or that annotation is attached to an existing referent.\n\napi.genius.com/\nreferents?web\\_page\\_id=10347\n Authorization: Bearer\nAccess Token\nSee details about using an access token in the authentication section below.\n \nGET /referents\nReferents by content item or user responsible for an included annotation.\n\nYou may pass only one of song\\_id and web\\_page\\_id, not both.\n\ncreated\\_by\\_id ID of a user to get referents for\nUser ID\nsong\\_id ID of a song to get referents for\nSong ID\nweb\\_page\\_id ID of a web page to get referents for\n10347\ntext\\_format Format for text bodies related to the document.

See details of each option here\nText Format\nAuthentication\nAccess for Apps Without Users\nIf your application doesn't include user-specific behaviors you can use the client access token associated with your API instead of tokens for authenticated users. These tokens are only valid for read-only endpoints that are not restricted by a required scope.\n\nYou can get a client access token by clicking \"Generate Access Token\" on the API Client management page.\n\nGenius uses the OAuth2 standard for making API calls on behalf of individual users. Requests are authenticated with an Access Token sent in an HTTP header (or as a request parameter if you must).\n\nAll interaction with the API must be done over HTTPS.\n\nAn example request would look like this:\n\nhttps://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize?\nclient\\_id=YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID&\nredirect\\_uri=YOUR\\_REDIRECT\\_URI&\nscope=REQUESTED\\_SCOPE&\nstate=SOME\\_STATE\\_VALUE&\nresponse\\_type=code\nGetting an Access Token\nStart by directing a user of your application to Genius's authentication page at https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize with the following query parameters:\n\nclient\\_id: Your application's Client ID, as listed on the API Client management page\nredirect\\_uri: The URI Genius will redirect the user to after they've authorized your application; it must be the same as the one set for the API client on the management page\nscope: The permissions your application is requesting as a space-separated list (see available scopes below)\nstate: A value that will be returned with the code redirect for maintaining arbitrary state through the authorization process\nresponse\\_type: Always \"code\"\nMore About State\nOne important use for this value is increased security—by including a unique, difficult to guess value (say, a hash of a user session value), potential attackers can be prevented from sending phony redirects to your app.\n\nOn the authentication page the user can choose to allow your application to access Genius on their behalf. They'll be asked to sign in (or, if necessary, create an account) first. Then the user is redirected to https://YOUR\\_REDIRECT\\_URI/?code=CODE&state=SOME\\_STATE\\_VALUE.\n\nYour application can exchange the code query parameter from the redirect for an access token by making a POST request to https://api.genius.com/oauth/token with the following request body data:\n\n{\n \"code\": \"CODE\\_FROM\\_REDIRECT\",\n \"client\\_id\": \"YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID\",\n \"client\\_secret\": \"YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_SECRET\",\n \"redirect\\_uri\": \"YOUR\\_REDIRECT\\_URI\",\n \"response\\_type\": \"code\",\n \"grant\\_type\": \"authorization\\_code\"\n}\ncode: The code query parameter from the redirect to your redirect\\_uri\nclient\\_secret: Your application's Client Secret, as listed on the API Client management page\ngrant\\_type: Aways \"authorization\\_code\"\nclient\\_id: As above\nredirect\\_uri: As above\nresponse\\_type: As above\nMost of these are the same values as used in the initial request.\n\n{\n \"access\\_token\": \"ACCESS\\_TOKEN\"\n}\nThe response body will be an object with the token as the value for the access\\_token key. Save the token and use it to make requests on behalf of the authorizing user.\n\nAvailable Scopes\nAccess tokens can only be used for resources that are covered by the scopes provided when they created. These are the available scopes and the endpoints they grant permission for:\n\nScope Endpoints\nme GET /account\ncreate\\_annotation POST /annotations\nmanage\\_annotation PUT /annotations/:id\nDELETE /annotations/:id\nvote PUT /annotations/:id/upvote\nPUT /annotations/:id/downvote\nPUT /annotations/:id/unvote\nUsing An Access Token\nGET /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: CompuServe Classic/1.22\nAccept: application/json\nHost: api.genius.com\nAuthorization: Bearer ACCESS\\_TOKEN\nTo make authenticated requests with an access token, include it in an HTTP Authorization header preceded by the word \"Bearer\" and a space. For example, the value of the header could be Bearer 1234tokentokentoken.\n\nPassing the token in the authorization header is the preferred way to authenticate API requests. However, the API also supports providing the token as the access\\_token query parameter of a GET request or element of a POST body.\n\nResponse Format\nGET https://api.genius.com/web\\_pages/lookup?canonical\\_url=http://example.com\n{\n \"meta\": {\n \"status\": 200\n },\n \"response\": {\n \"web\\_page\": {\n \"annotation\\_count\":7,\n \"id\": 1480,\n ...\n }\n }\n}\nAll Genius API responses are JSON. Every JSON response has a meta field with a status value that is an integer representation of the HTTP status code for the response.\n\nFor successful requests, there is also a top-level response field which will be a nested object. For example, a request for details about annotations on a web page:\n\nErrors\nGET https://api.genius.com/apples\n{\n \"meta\": {\n \"status\": 404,\n \"message\": \"Not found\"\n }\n}\nIf a request fails or errors (i.e. the status values is 4xx or 5xx). the meta field will also have a message value that is a string with details about the error. For example, a request to a non-existent API endpoint:\n\nText Formatting (text\\_format option)\n{\n \"plain\": \"A hilarious word!\",\n \"html\": \"<p>A hilarious word!</p>\",\n \"dom\": {\n \"tag\": \"root\",\n \"children\": [ {\n \"tag\": \"p\",\n \"children\": [ \"A hilarious word!\" ]\n } ]\n }\n}\nMany API requests accept a text\\_format query parameter that can be used to specify how text content is formatted. The value for the parameter must be one or more of plain, html, and dom. The value returned will be an object with key-value pairs of formats and results:\n\nplain is just plain text, no markup\nhtml is a string of unescaped HTML suitable for rendering by a browser\ndom is a nested object representing and HTML DOM hierarchy that can be used to programmatically present structured content\n\n----\n\nWrite me a NodeJS authentication flow for this API using ExpressJS"}, {"id": 9670, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "How does the Jubilee Pool compare to other lidos in terms of its history and architecture?"}, {"id": 9671, "actor": "Cooking & Healthy Eating", "prompt": "What can be cooked on steam?"}, {"id": 9672, "actor": "Business Marketing & Social Media Strategy", "prompt": "Topic: Building a digital business with A.I.\nFor the above topic, what are some common aspirations that people have?"}, {"id": 9673, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet that uses the `VirtualAlloc` function to allocate memory in a Windows operating system.\n\n```cpp\n\tAddress=VirtualAlloc(0,Size,MEM_COMMIT,PAGE_NOACCESS);\n\tif(!Address) {\n\t\tcerr<<\"VirtualAllocFailed!!!\n\";\n\t\treturn 0;\n```\n\nYour task is to complete the code by handling the case when `VirtualAlloc` fails.

The three are attending the preliminary meetings but will not enter the conclave.\nPaolo Gabriele, the pope’s butler, was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. The documents alleged corruption and infighting over the running of its bank. Gabriele was jailed and later pardoned by Benedict.\nBenedict decided to make the report available only to his successor but one Vatican official said the three elderly cardinals who wrote it could “use their discernment to give any necessary guidance” to fellow cardinals without violating their pact of secrecy about its specific contents.\nAt two news conferences on Monday, both the Vatican spokesman and two American cardinals refused to be drawn on the report and whether cardinals had asked to be briefed on it.\nSpecific matters discussed at the preliminary meetings are covered by secrecy.\n“Certainly, there can be various members of the college of cardinals who want information they feel is useful or pertinent to the situation of the curia,” spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said, referring to the central Vatican administration.\nChicago’s Cardinal Francis George was equally coy when asked if cardinals wanted to be briefed on the report.\n“As far as the state of the church here in Rome is concerned, I would imagine that as we move along there will be questioning of cardinals involved in the governing of the curia to see what they think has to be changed and in that context anything can come up,” George said at a separate news briefing.\nCardinals will be using the meetings this week to get to know each other and decide when to start a conclave to choose a man to lead the 1.2 billion-member church.\nThe Vatican appears to be aiming to have a new pope elected next week and officially installed several days later so he can preside over the Holy Week ceremonies starting with Palm Sunday on March 24 and culminating in Easter the following Sunday.\n“The thing that is in the back of all our minds, I think, is Holy Week. We’d like to be done before Holy Week starts, have a pope, and we all go back to our dioceses,” George said.\nHigh on the agenda at the general congregations will be the daunting challenges facing the next pontiff, including the sexual abuse crisis in the church and the Vatileaks scandal.\n“We need a man of governance, by that I mean a man who is able with the people he chooses to help him in an intimate way to govern the church,” Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, the former Archbishop of Westminster in London, told BBC radio.\nThe cardinals will hold one or two meetings a day. The date of the conclave will be decided after all the 115 cardinal electors arrive. Twelve still had not arrived by Monday.\nIt is widely expected to start next week.\nThe crisis involving sexual abuse of children by priests and inappropriate behavior among adult clerics continues to haunt the church and has rarely been out of the headlines.\nOne elector - Cardinal Keith O’Brien - quit as Edinburgh archbishop last week and pulled out of attending the conclave because of accusations that he behaved inappropriately with priests and seminarians in the past.\nHe at first denied the allegations but on Sunday issued a statement apologizing that “my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal”.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Could you provide more information on the secret report into leaks about alleged corruption and mismanagement in the Vatican, and why some cardinals are requesting to be briefed on its contents?"}, {"id": 9747, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "explain \"infantile amnesia\" with citations from researchers who study it"}, {"id": 9748, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "With no explanation, chose the best option from \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Why does the author indicate that \"The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area\"(paragraph 5)?\nIn 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a dramatic example of how social interactions can produce and enforce regular spacing in a population. They studied competition and nest spacing in populations of stingless bees in tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these bees do no sting, rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites.\nStingless bees are abundant in tropical and subtropical environments, where they gather nectar and pollen from a wide variety of flowers. They generally nest in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless bees are highly aggressive to members of their species from other colonies, while other species are not. Aggressive species usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in high-density clumps. Nonaggressive species feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers.\nHubbell and Johnson studied several species of stingless bees to determine whether there is a relationship between aggressiveness and patterns of colony distribution. They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions, while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped (clumpeD. distribution. They concentrated their studies on a thirteen-hectare tract of tropical dry forest that contained numerous nests of nine species of stingless bees.\nThough Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee behavior might affect colony distributions, they recognized that the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also affect distributions.So as one of the first steps in their study, they mapped the distributions of trees suitable for nesting. They found that potential nest trees were distributed randomly through the study area. They also found that the number of potential nest sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. What did these measurements show the researchers? The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by availability of suitable trees, and a clumped or regular distribution of colonies was not due to an underlying clumped or regular distribution of potential nest sites.\nHubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine species of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these species were distributed regularly. All four species with regular nest distributions were highly aggressive to bees from other colonies of their own species. The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area.\nThe researchers also studied the process by which the aggressive species establish new colonies. Their observations provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distribution of these species. Aggressive species apparently mark prospective nest sites with pheromones, chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their species. The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospective nest site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests.\nIf workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective nest at the same time, they may fight for possession. Fights may be escalated into protracted battles.The researchers observed battles over a nest tree that lasted for two weeks. Each dawn, fifteen to thirty workers from two competing colonies arrived at the contested nest site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew vertically to a height of about three meters, and then grappled each other to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they separated, faced off, and performed another aerial display. Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M. each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next day just after dawn. While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produced no obvious mortality, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.\n\nA: To introduce the hypothesis that, within the same species, not all colonies are aggressive.\nB: To indicate that research results confirmed that nest distribution was related to aggressiveness.\nC: To point out that both aggressive and nonaggressive species are equally successful at finding nest sites.\nD: To identify research results that contradicted Hubbell and Johnson's original hypothesis."}, {"id": 9749, "actor": "Prime Numbers & Mathematical Symbols", "prompt": "46298385314 / 1 =?\nNumbers and symbols only, please."}]
