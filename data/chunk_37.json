Imagine a hypothetical scenario where every household in the world has adopted a policy of recycling waste and electronic devices, including batteries. Sounds great, doesn't it? But what if this process has to be carried out in a closed-loop system? This means that waste cannot be exported to other countries. Can you think of a series of logical steps that would ensure the safe disposal of electronics and batteries within this system? But that's not all. Can you also evaluate the potential risks and benefits of implementing such a system on a large scale?

Your task is to understand the code and identify the purpose and functionality of each function.\n\n- The `groupByRace` function takes a parameter `list` of type `TierList`. It iterates over the keys of `list` using the `reduce` function. For each key, it retrieves the corresponding value from `list`. The value is stored in the `minions` variable. The function then groups the `minions` by their `race` property using the `groupBy` function from the lodash library. The result is stored in an object `acc`, with the `race` as the key and the grouped `minions` as the value. The `acc` object is updated with each iteration and eventually returned as the final result.\n\n- The unnamed function within the `groupByRace` function is used as the callback function for the `groupBy` function. It maps `value` to `value.race`. If `value.race` is `null` or `undefined`, it is mapped to the string `'INVALID'`.\n\n- The `getTierCN` function takes a parameter `techLevel` of type `number`. It uses a `switch` statement to check the value of `techLevel`. Depending on the value, the function executes different code paths, but the code snippet is incomplete and lacks the cases and code blocks after the initial case.\n\nYour task is to complete the `getTierCN` function by adding the missing cases and code blocks for all possible values of `techLevel`. Each case should return a descriptive string that represents the corresponding tier in a game. The tier descriptions should follow the pattern `Tier X`, where `X` is the value of `techLevel`.
