Why does the author indicate that \"The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area\"(paragraph 5)?", "In 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a dramatic example of how social interactions can produce and enforce regular spacing in a population. They studied competition and nest spacing in populations of stingless bees in tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these bees do no sting, rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites.", "Stingless bees are abundant in tropical and subtropical environments, where they gather nectar and pollen from a wide variety of flowers. They generally nest in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless bees are highly aggressive to members of their species from other colonies, while other species are not. Aggressive species usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in high-density clumps. Nonaggressive species feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers.", "Hubbell and Johnson studied several species of stingless bees to determine whether there is a relationship between aggressiveness and patterns of colony distribution. They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions, while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped (clumpeD. distribution. They concentrated their studies on a thirteen-hectare tract of tropical dry forest that contained numerous nests of nine species of stingless bees.", "Though Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee behavior might affect colony distributions, they recognized that the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also affect distributions.So as one of the first steps in their study, they mapped the distributions of trees suitable for nesting. They found that potential nest trees were distributed randomly through the study area. They also found that the number of potential nest sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. What did these measurements show the researchers? The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by availability of suitable trees, and a clumped or regular distribution of colonies was not due to an underlying clumped or regular distribution of potential nest sites.", "Hubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine species of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these species were distributed regularly. All four species with regular nest distributions were highly aggressive to bees from other colonies of their own species. The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area.", "The researchers also studied the process by which the aggressive species establish new colonies. Their observations provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distribution of these species. Aggressive species apparently mark prospective nest sites with pheromones, chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their species. The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospective nest site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests.", "If workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective nest at the same time, they may fight for possession. Fights may be escalated into protracted battles.The researchers observed battles over a nest tree that lasted for two weeks. Each dawn, fifteen to thirty workers from two competing colonies arrived at the contested nest site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew vertically to a height of about three meters, and then grappled each other to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they separated, faced off, and performed another aerial display. Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M. each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next day just after dawn. While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produced no obvious mortality, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.", "A: To introduce the hypothesis that, within the same species, not all colonies are aggressive.", "B: To indicate that research results confirmed that nest distribution was related to aggressiveness.", "C: To point out that both aggressive and nonaggressive species are equally successful at finding nest sites.", "D: To identify research results that contradicted Hubbell and Johnson's original hypothesis."]}, {"id": 33205, "title": "Prime Numbers & Mathematical Symbols", "content": ["46298385314 / 1 =?", "Numbers and symbols only, please."]}, {"id": 33206, "title": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "content": ["I'm in bed but I can't sleep.

Together, texture and GFOV could potentially, significantly impact people’s ability to accurately judge distances from SVS displays.", "In this experiment, 18 pilots made judgments about the relative distance of terrain points displayed in 112 noninteractive 5-s simulations of an SVS head-down display (see example below).", "Texture and GFOV were the independent variables. There were 7 textures (three base concepts and all possible combinations; see figure below) and 2 GFOVs (30o and 60o). All the participants experienced all the combinations of texture and GFOV level. The dependent measure was the absolute error in the distance judgment in nautical miles.", "Use the data set (SVSdata.csv) to analyze whether texture, GFOV, or their interaction significantly impacted the absolute distance error.

Ryan (R-Wis.) and two of the country’s most conservative Republican governors has become one of the loudest and most persuasive voices in the debate over new work requirements in the food stamp program.", "The Foundation for Government Accountability — headed by a former adviser to Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) — spent six years testing welfare changes in Kansas, Mississippi and other states before taking its ideas to Washington in 2017.", "On Friday, those ideas — and the FGA’s leveraging of state political connections and policy one-liners to become a fixture in GOP strategy discussions — were in the spotlight when the House voted on a farm bill that sought sweeping changes to work requirements for food stamp recipients.", "The bill ultimately failed because of unrelated GOP struggles over immigration. But political observers said the inclusion of proposed changes to food stamps was testimony to the FGA’s growing influence in key Republican circles.", "The work requirements at issue Friday would have fundamentally changed the food stamp program for many adult recipients. Under the plan, most able-bodied people between 18 and 60 would have to work or attend a state training program for 20 hours a week to receive benefits.", "House Republicans — including Ryan, who was introduced to the group in 2016 through Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback — have repeatedly proffered the FGA’s analysis as proof that most Americans support strict work rules in welfare programs and that such rules boost income and employment.", "The FGA, as well as more-established think tanks such as Heritage and the American Enterprise Institute, has long argued that welfare recipients leave poverty faster when their benefits are tied to employment.", "But unlike the old guard, the FGA — with its low national profile, remote staff of 26 and annual donations of about $7 million in 2017 — until now devoted itself to state policy, said chief executive Tarren Bragdon.", "That focus changed in 2016, the year Republicans swept the White House, the House and the Senate, and Bragdon met Ryan at the behest of Brownback, the speaker's former boss. The FGA had worked with Brownback to strengthen food stamp work requirements in Kansas, a cause that Ryan supported.", "At a meeting with Bragdon in May 2016 and in subsequent conversations, Ryan expressed interest in the FGA’s work and research, Bragdon said. In January 2017, the FGA hired its first federal lobbyist. One year later, Bragdon made a presentation to House GOP leaders on “how to successfully move people from welfare to work” in programs such as SNAP, which provides food benefits.", "The FGA pursued that goal in the past by advancing bills that bar states from seeking waivers to food stamp requirements, as well as advocating for Medicaid work requirements and campaigning against Medicaid expansion.", "Libertarian and conservative charitable funds, including Donors Trust and the Bradley Foundation, have fronted roughly a quarter of the money behind these efforts, according to tax documents, while the balance has come from anonymous individual donors.", "Bragdon’s staff includes veterans of conservative administrations in Kansas and Texas, as well as advocates for overhauling welfare whom Bragdon met as the head of the right-wing Maine Heritage Policy Center and later as an adviser to LePage in the late aughts.", "Over a decade in and around the Maine statehouse, Bragdon and a cohort of young conservatives gained a reputation for outraging the other side of the aisle. Under LePage, Maine placed a five-year time limit on cash welfare benefits and reinstated full SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults.", "Since leaving Maine, Bragdon has sought to export many of the state’s policies. The FGA developed model state legislation, dubbed the HOPE Act, which bars states from seeking federal waivers from SNAP’s work rules. The bill has been introduced in 16 states since 2016 and passed in Kansas, Mississippi and Wisconsin. The FGA says elements of the bill have been adopted in 28 states.", "The FGA also refers activist social service administrators to positions in Republican administrations, a service it advertises on its “FGA Talent Bank” as part of its work to overhaul welfare.", "And it has churned out a steady stream of infographics, opinion polls and first-person videos to promote its policies, many trumpeting a 2016 FGA study from Kansas that claimed that the reinstatement of SNAP work requirements prompted thousands of unemployed Kansans to get jobs and more than doubled their average incomes.", "The study, while much promoted by Republicans, has been panned by both liberal and conservative economists for cherry-picking data. Among other issues, the paper reports outcomes only from former food stamp recipients who found jobs after they lost benefits, said Jeffrey Grogger, an applied microeconomist at the University of Chicago who has studied welfare.", "Grogger also said the paper fails to establish a direct relationship between the welfare policy changes and outcomes for recipients. Most welfare recipients obtain jobs and leave the program anyway, he said, regardless of work requirements.", "And he said the paper is at odds with the scientific literature, which has largely found that such rules do not greatly improve recipients’ incomes and may even hurt them.", "In addition to the Kansas study, House Republicans have distributed an FGA analysis of three-year-old U.S. Department of Agriculture data that breaks down the number of unemployed, able-bodied SNAP recipients by state. A Washington Post review of more recent USDA data suggests that the current figures on food stamp recipients are lower than the FGA has claimed.", "The group has also circulated polling numbers suggesting that almost all Americans support stricter work requirements, but those figures have been faulted by observers like Peter Germanis, a conservative economist who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, for oversimplifying public opinion and the available evidence.", "In an interview, Bragdon defended his team’s analysis, saying other researchers are free to use “different approaches.” The FGA's poll results are in line with those conducted by other groups, he said. And the FGA prepared its state-by-state analysis last year, before the most recent data was available.", "Bragdon said he is “proud” of his group's research, which he has pushed to get in front of as many lawmakers as possible. The FGA specializes in slick policy one-pagers, which — with their color-coded headlines and catchy graphics — appear to owe a debt to Bragdon’s brother, Trevor, a behavioral scientist who has worked with the FGA and specializes in “persuasive branding” for conservative causes.", "One of Trevor Bragdon’s employees, Sam Adolphsen, is currently on loan to the foundation, where he carries the title “senior fellow” and recently testified about SNAP before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.", "The FGA’s emphasis on policy messaging and marketing has, experts said, differentiated the group from traditional think tanks.", "On the farm bill, the FGA mobilized in a huge way to support the Republican plan, canvassing lawmakers’ offices and churning out a stream of widely disseminated “one-pagers” designed to deflect both liberal and tea party criticisms.", "An April strategy email to House Republicans from GOP leadership included four one-pagers, as well as four FGA videos and 50 graphics featuring FGA's SNAP recipient estimates. On Wednesday, Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) published a strongly worded defense of the plan, exclusively citing FGA research. A day earlier, Ryan appeared in an FGA video touting the value of work.", "The FGA was focused on funneling data to lawmakers, said Kristina Rasmussen, who lobbies for Opportunity Solutions Project, the FGA's advocacy arm. She drove 12 hours from her home in Illinois this week to field Republicans' questions about the work requirement plan.", "On Monday, Rasmussen was optimistic that the measure would pass.", "Correction: The story has been corrected to remove an economist's comment that the FGA's study did not track all relevant welfare recipients.

What You WANT - the PROBLEM With MANIFESTING! | Michael A Singer | Top 10 Rules - YouTube\"", "Video Transcript: \"this whole thing about abundance and attracting to yourself what it is that you want and how to use mantras and spirituality to make sure you have what you want true spirituality is about not wanting is about being filled with joy from inside and then sharing that outside it's not about attracting to yourself what you want people ask me is there a law of attraction yes and you better be scared of it because if it's true that you attract what your mind is thinking you better take a look at what your mind is thinking what about your mind all day when it's complaining and it's yelling at people and it doesn't like stuff but if you're attracting that way so you eventually catch on that it is not about getting what you want it is about learning to find out that what you really want is to stay open and not have conditions on that openness and then it comes down to how do you do that are people capable of doing that or is that just reserved for you know some special beings Buddha and Christ that have walked the face of the Earth everybody is capable of that if I tell you to pick up five thousand pounds you may not be able to do that so I've told you to do something that you have never done and you're not doing it so you may not be able to do it but if you're actually already doing something and I tell you not to do it you're always capable of that because you're the one who's doing it need motivations watch a top ten with believe Nation hey it's Evan Carmichael and I make these videos my first business I struggled to believe in myself I quit on my business partner and the thing that saved me was watching the successful stories of entrepreneurs they gave me the inspiration to keep going as well as the strategies of what to do and quite honestly I still need their stories and motivation today as well so today let's learn from one of the best Michael Singer and my take on his top 10 rules of success enjoy inside you are the one who's closing your heart you close it you are the one who's closing your mind you do that they're your thoughts it's your feelings they're nobody else's so you are in there doing these things so if I tell you the way to stay open is to not close I don't teach how to stay open that's more like finding out how to get what you want I'm interested in you learning to not close but a difference if I say to you I want you to open your heart right now you wouldn't even know how to start but if I say to you somebody says and you don't like don't close you know where to start right because it's happening inside of you and you see the tendency to do it all I'm asking you to do is don't do that I'm telling you that will take you the whole way don't worry about opening worry about not closing there are going to be events that unfold in your life that naturally open you a beautiful sunset a bird singing sometimes you get what your mind wants all right you open great nothing wrong with that don't close how come it only last a minute I'm going to see a beautiful sunset you feel like oh my God I looked into the face of God then you go right back into your mind with all your problems why why don't you learn to not close why don't you get some openness start to work with yourself to not close and this is how to get what you really want the teeth the Deep spiritual teachings are really teaching you how to get what you want because what you want is to feel love and joy and happiness all the time and so if you can get that from within you then can share it rule number two is discover your real self the mind is very strong and one of the things the Mind does is develop methodologies or ways of thinking that let it interact with life and not get hurt and be more comfortable and it's the ego when we develop a self-concept and we change it through our lives but in general there's a self-concept sitting under there saying I was the one that did this and I was the one that went to the school and I'm the one that went there and the one that my father left or stayed or whatever the hell it is excuse me and basically uh all of this unfolds and you end up developing patterns of thinking based upon the experiences you've had all right and what I'm saying at least certainly in my experience is that's not what makes you wake up that's what keeps you from waking up all right the fact that you're identifying with these past experiences and saying that's who I am well it's not who you are you are watching your ego you see it get upset you see it fix things you see it have Concepts and Views and Etc et cetera and even you're obviously very intelligent you can use your intellect to support the ego to support that and and so on right and I'm sure yes you're a very special person very intelligent person and therefore that becomes part of your self-concept okay and then you say a religious person part of your self-concept all of these things are ways you think of yourself and there's nothing at all wrong with that it's wonderful you've been successful you're happy you're doing well all right I'm not happy I'm not doing well I just said that and also like weeping openly at this moment okay but listen to me right that identification with your personal self which is just your mind's thoughts are what keep you from waking up rule number three team is recognize your needs instead of asking why am I not okay why am I not okay you're asking what do I need to be okay that's the major difference of whether you're growing inwardly or you're attached to struggling externally is you think I can only be okay if I get the things that I got before or similar you extrapolate right things that made me had a relationship and eighth grade and it was so beautiful and she was redheaded okay my wife no that's not true all right he was redheaded and she left you know should her parents move right and it was never a bad experience in that relationship it was just the most perfect relationship you've ever had right you understand now if I'm grown up and I I go on a date and shoot a red hat she redheaded I have a pretense propensity toward being open you just asked a question why do we think we need these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man everyone would be proud of me and I feel like I'm helping the ecology and so all of a sudden I'm not okay I'm going to go to Tesla and if I get a Tesla oh my God for a while how am I doing wonderful so that's how you develop your preferences these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man and or perhaps a little time without the children and we make our list nobody's judging just be honest you put that down the purpose of this discussion is no matter what you put on that list unless you're very highly evolved my experience is it's not really what you want it's not that it's wrong it's just not really what you want and the way I prove that is as follows let's say you put down I want a relationship I want to meet somebody I want to have that special relationship and then I would ask you what if you would be the most amazing thing but it's Hollow for you you go there and you thought it would turn you on but it doesn't and you just Lowe's going to work and you're just not excited about it so therein lies the what do you really want because what you're going to find is if you were given the opportunity to have a relationship with that person I just described or have the job I just described but it didn't do SWOT for you and it left you hollow inside you would say I don't want it in fact if it's this video absolutely for free there's a link in the description below go click on it and start building the momentum in your life and your business I'll see you there rule number five is overcome anxiety what you want to do is say what's behind the anxiety so when when people talk I don't help people make decisions but we talk about decision making is the first thing that matters is what's your motive now what should you do if how can you figure out what to do if you don't even know your motive right and my you became 23 years old I realized that that voice was running my life and that's what you're saying if it wasn't comfortable I left if it you know whatever it was it was determining what I said it was determined how I acted it was determining everything about my life and yet I didn't know a thing about that voice why was it saying what it was saying why why is it like one person and not another because when you like somebody your voice says I like her so what that come from right and if all of a sudden it said no I don't think so I was in his glory because you know you pull yourself aside it's going to say a lot of stuff made me realize I don't listen to that thing that thing's crazy it just changed his mind all the time it says this it says that like the reason people drink and do drugs is because that thing's driving them crazy do you understand that are you trying to get away from that in inner mess that's going on inside so basically over the course of many years I started an experiment which was what would happen talking about the personal mind I like this I don't like that I believe in this I don't believe in that I want this to happen oh my God I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I'll die if it rains that kind of junk just the personal noise that instead of honoring and respecting life is judging it and trying to tell me how to make life be my way instead of my respecting that life took 13. notice amazing thing that energy that was all weird because you didn't touch it it changed it was able to come up all right or you start using affirmation right you sit there and say oh come on this is probably a an older person like my grandmother my grandmother I do yes yes that's right they get to drive and I should not be talking at them or bothering them or even sending them bad vibes maybe they should not be driving any faster well well and the point is it's a latter part of their life and at I trained Mickey this I trained Michael this way all right as I sit there and I look and I say how did it get hot be quiet how did it get hot what do you mean why is it hot well because there's a son out there you mean there's a star 93 billion miles away and you're it's hot it's so hot that you feel it's heat here I'm in Gainesville Florida Miami is about 300 miles away I asked them how big would a fire have to be in Miami for you to steal it in Gainesville if the whole town caught fire you would not even know being grateful and turned on by all of the amazing things that are happening in front of me and all the past experiences I got to have why don't I just enjoy all that and then come into life filled with love filled with joy and give the hold of my being to the moments that are unfolding in front of me that's that's what spirituality says so it's not about renunciation it's not about things are wrong and things are right it's about understanding that you did this you did this with your mind you set something reminds you of them when they were negative experience they tend to close you and that is where you get your list of what you want that's why all of our lists are different everyone's listening is totally different someone tells you this is the same as yours they're manipulating you because everyone has had different experiences and based upon those experiences it left these Impressions on your mind and you came up with this list of what I want so when you make the list of what you want make it through this and even if I don't whatever it is I will be a better person because of this if you're in into God running everything if that's your state God knows what he's doing there are so many different things that you can do with positive thinking to create a nicer environment inside in my opinion you have an obligation to do that both for yourself for the health of your body for people around you you just lift yourself up like he just says one should raise the selfless self not trample down the of course put aside some time in the morning and evening to remind yourself that this is what I'm doing annual number 10 the last one before some very special bonus Clips is work on yourself all you can be responsible for is yourself your starting position is right you have to evolve with the different situations that are presented to you and my experiences if you do that the rest will happen the people around you will be raised naturally understand that like if you bring anger into a situation imagine a household or always did you build this building I said yes he said would you build an addition on my house I swear to God that's exactly what happened all right and because I was surrendering to life nothing inside of me wanted to build clothes in the garage of this Sheriff all right I'm not even a builder I built a couple of buildings on my own land you know rough sawn Timber Etc and I said yes and that founded my first company built with love and I ended up building a custom houses and this and that and then I got into computers and the next pretty well because you made it this far in a video I want to celebrate you most people start and don't finish most people never actually follow through most people say they want something but they don't ever do the work to actually get it but you're different you are special believe Nation you made it here all the way to the end and I love you so as a special celebration if you put a hashtag believe down in the comments Below on this video I will showcase you and
