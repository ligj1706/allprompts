low-carb pancakes and took them to the streets to see if people could tell the difference between these two recipes and regular pancakes made with all-purpose flour would you like to try some pancakes if you're keto it can be a struggle to find a pancake recipe that doesn't taste like an egg coconut flour or cardboard but I think I found two recipes that can stand up to the tried and true pancake let's see who comes out on top first I'm making my coconut flour pancakes that have almost a five-star perfect review on my website ketofocus.com but don't let the words coconut flour scare you I know some people don't like the flavor of coconut flour but I have some tips to help diminish that flavor in these pancakes I found that adding 8 ounces of softened cream cheese helps to neutralize that strong coconut flavor but it also helps neutralize the egg flavor since we're adding four eggs to this recipe why so many well that's what's going to help puff up our pancake since we're not using flour with gluten we have to add more eggs then add in a half a cup of coconut flour and I do believe that the brand of coconut flour matters when it comes to lessening that coconut flavor my favorite brands of coconut flour is the one from Thrive market and also Anthony's coconut flour then add in a quarter cup of sugar-free sweetener and half a cup of heavy cream or nut milk and for a leavening agent add two teaspoons of baking powder then one teaspoon of vanilla extract for flavor using a blender helps to get this batter smooth and make sure that all that cream cheese is broken up but you don't want to over blend it or else you're not going to be left with puffy pancakes instead you may want to mix all your ingredients first and then add the eggs at the end but I didn't do that here when it comes to cooking these pancakes I recommend a non-stick electric griddle over Skillet because the heat is more evenly distributed since this batter is thick you only want to add enough to make a three inch pancake and cook it slowly over low heat low heat that's the key this will give it time to cook without burning the bottom have patience because it's going to take around four to six minutes on the first side you know it's ready to flip when you can easily slide a spatula underneath the pancake drag it and then flip if you feel it getting stuck like I did with this pancake in fact I felt it tear I wasn't patient and now I have to pay the price with a pancake that's not not pretty let these cook for a few more minutes on this side until they're cooked through I think these pancakes have incredible flavor and I don't taste the coconut flour but let's see what other people think before I show you the next pancake recipe let's talk about my sponsor for today's video and not the fact that I'm wearing completely different clothes my sponsor for today's video is element electrolytes when you wake up in the morning chances are you're dehydrated because no one drinks water and sleeps at the same time I think that's like physically impossible it's called drowning probably to rehydrate so that I can have the most energy to start my day out right I have a glass of element electrolytes these electrolytes contain a science-backed electrolyte mix of a thousand milligrams of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium sounds like a lot of electrolytes right but you actually need that many especially if you follow a low carb diet because a lot of those electrolytes are fleshed out right now element is offering my viewers a free sample pack with any order that's eight single serving packets free with any element order it's a really good way so you can try all eight flavors all you have to do is go to drinkelement.com ketofocus this deal is only available through my link so go to drinkelement.com keto Focus right after I show you how to make another amazing keto pancake recipe now let's change outfits again instead of coconut flour another low carb gluten-free flour that's used is almond flour the problem with almond flour is that it can burn easily which is why I didn't use it in this blender pancake recipe that I just showed you because they have to cook for a long time on one side just increases the risk that your pancakes are going to burn with a few simple ingredients you probably already have on hand you can make a fat sack of fluffy pancakes with little effort start with your dry ingredients mix one and a third cup of almond flour make sure you use blanched super fine almond flour then add one teaspoon of baking powder and a half a teaspoon of salt mix together then add a quarter cup of heavy cream or nut milk two eggs a tablespoon of sweetener a teaspoon of vanilla and since I used heavy cream I found that my batter was a little bit too thick so I'm sending it out with a couple tablespoons of nut milk you shouldn't have to do this if you use nut milk from the beginning since it does have a thinner consistency and to keep our pancakes from being too dry I'm adding in one tablespoon of melted butter plus it gives our pancakes this buttery finish the consistency of this batter is more like regular pancake batter scoop onto a preheated griddle over low medium heat and let these cook for a few minutes on each side until golden brown now it's time for our blind taste test these two are going up against Kodiak pancake mix because that's really all I had in my pantry which pancake is made with flour they look really good I don't know it's kind of hard to tell this pancake is made with regular flour nope that's the pancake made with almond flour can you make one of these for breakfast I'm tired of bacon and eggs if you were to click right here for more ideas that aren't bacon and

ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH, www.ProPhaseLabs.com) today reported its financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017. As previously announced, effective March 29, 2017 and with the approval of the Company’s stockholders, the Company completed the sale of assets comprised principally of the sale of intellectual property rights and other assets relating to the Cold-EEZE® brand and product line (collectively, referred to herein as the “Cold-EEZE® Business”) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”). As a consequence of the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company has classified as discontinued operations the (i) gain from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, (ii) all gains and losses attributable to the Cold-EEZE® Business and (iii) the income tax expense attributed to the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business. Excluded from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business were the Company’s accounts receivable and inventory, and it also retained all liabilities associated with the Cold-EEZE® Business operations arising prior to March 29, 2017.\nNet sales from continuing operations were $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net sales of $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.\nThe Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2017, of $1.5 million, or ($0.09) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or ($0.08) per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Company incurred a net loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2017, of $845,000, or ($0.05) per share, compared to net income from discontinued operations of $198,000, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.\nNet sales from continuing operations were $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net sales of $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. In addition, the loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nAs a consequence of the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, the Company realized a gain, net of income tax, of $26.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The gain on the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business is classified as a component of our discontinued operations at June 30, 2017 and is net of approximately $19.5 million for estimated income taxes arising from the sale. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company also realized an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $18.1 million as a consequence of the utilization of the federal and state net operating losses.\nUtilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain statutory limitations. Based on the Company’s preliminary analysis, it does not believe that the current net operating loss carryforwards are subject to these limitations as of June 30, 2017. However, until the Company completes a final analysis upon filing of its 2017 income tax return, there can be no assurances that the preliminary analysis is accurate or complete. Should the Company identify any limitations upon the completion of its final analysis, the impact could be material to the financial statements and that the Company could incur additional income tax expense arising from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business.\nThe Company realized net income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, of $15.5 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million, or ($0.15) per share, for the six months ended June 31, 2016. The Company realized net income from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, of $26.9 million, or $1.58 per share, compared to net income from discontinued operations of $168,000, or $0.01 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nMr. Karkus also noted, “We started shipping our new dietary supplement, Legendz XL®, to a major retail drug chain during the first quarter 2017.

What do you do then when you have a campus that is teeming with monkeys, suspicious of strangers?\nIn India, the age-old practice is to employ a madari, a langur-trainer. The idea is that, langurs, which are more possessive of its territory, would chase away the more common, Macaca mulatta that have become increasingly bold in human habitats. The catch though is the fact that according to the Prevention of Cruelty Animals Act,1960, langurs are protected species and keeping them is a crime.\nAfter years of dealing with the menace, according to the PGI officials, the institute of national repute managed to convey to Animal Welfare Board of India and various other committees, the urgency of the situation and get permission to hire langurs to keep the monkeys at bay at the institute.\n\"About eight years ago, a petition was filed in the high court for hiring langur keepers here. We presented our problems and the court allowed us to hire langur keepers. We had submitted a compliance report on this,\" said PC Sharma, chief security officer of PGI.\nBut the simian menace in the PGI refuses to go away despite hiring two langur keepers in the last decade. Though the monkey menace has reduced significantly with langurs around, the monkeys find some or the other way to enter the hospital. \"These animals are smart. The langurs are in the campus between 9am and 5pm. Guess what, the monkeys come after they leave and make a menace of themselves,\" said a security official.\nNow the institute is facing yet another problem: Finding trained langur keepers has become harder, as the profession is deemed illegal these days. Mostly of them come from Rajasthan. In PGI, every two years or so, the contracts of the langur keepers are renewed. Recently, the institute has floated a tender for hiring langur keepers. According to PGI, the ones previously employed demand more salary. \"Over the years, we have increased it from Rs 14,000 to Rs 21,000, a month. However, it's not easy to find these langur keepers and tenders have been floated repeatedly,\" said Sharma.\nIt is believed that the monkeys come from the forest area nearby. The easy availability of food is a big draw for them, agreed Sharma. And now with langur keepers at such short supply, it is not clear how the institute proposes to tackle this problem."}, {"id": 863, "actor": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "prompt": "**Q**\nIs the following a factual statement?\n\"Marlon Brando played the lead character in the original Godfather movie.\"\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n**A**\nyes\nHe was the godfather in Francis Ford Coppola's first movie of the three.\n\n\n\"The Samsung Galaxy S II came from designs made by Apple.\"\nIs the above claim true?\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\nno\nThe Samsung Galaxy S II was designed and produced by Samsung.\n\n\n**Q**\nClaim: \"The Peace Corps defeated the Axis Powers in World War II.\"\nIs the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n**A**\nno\nThe Peace Corps is a humanitarian organization that provides humanitarian aid, not a standing army.\n\n\nIs the following statement true?\n\"Many criminals in America lost their heads in 2020 to the Guillotine.\"\nno\nThe American criminal justice system does not use the guillotine as a method of excecution.\n\n\n**Q**\nYes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\n\"Zoology only consists of animals with fur.\"\n**A**\nno\nThe different branches of zoology covers all types of animals, for example, the vertebrae and invertebrate branch covers fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, worms, etc.\n\n\n**Q**\nIs the following a factual statement?\n\"Menstruation describes an illness in which the human reproductive system is effected.\"\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n**A**"}, {"id": 864, "actor": "Sustainable Packaging & Skin Care Products", "prompt": "How did the study conducted by Scion on waste streams associated with kiwifruit contribute to the development of the biospife project? Answer according to: Rights: © Copyright 2012. University of Waikato. All rights reserved.\nDeveloping the new compostable biospife involved a range of people and organisations with diverse knowledge and skills. Alistair Mowat of ZESPRI discusses some of the key people and organisations involved and the importance of the knowledge and expertise they contributed.\nCarbon footprint: The measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by a product, organisation, event or person.\nValue chain: All the companies and people that work together to produce and market a product.\nWaste stream: The total amount of waste material generated throughout all stages of the production of a product including packaging for transporting to market.\nWhen we look at the range of people that have been involved in the biospife project, we’ve drawn on quite a range of skills. One of the first set of skills was our research providers at Landcare Research who were very involved in the carbon footprinting study that we did, and that looked at all aspects of our carbon footprint associated with growing a kiwifruit in New Zealand and shipping that product to Europe and having it consumed in the UK. That study was very important because it put a weighting on the different components in our value chain which impacted on the carbon footprint. And in the case of the existing spife, that carbon footprint was around 3%.\nAnother important component was the group at Scion who undertook a study for us looking at our waste streams associated with kiwifruit, and they were able to quantify the amount of waste kiwifruit and other waste aspects from our industry – the hairs on the kiwifruit which are brushed off during the packing process, waste plastics and packaging materials, prunings in the orchards. They were able to draw up a range of ideas on what some of those waste streams could be utilised for. They identified an opportunity for converting some of these materials into bioplastics.\nThat original work wasn’t necessarily directed to the spife, but it provided a good foundation.\nAnother important group was the plastic manufacturer, who makes our existing spifes, had recognised that, as a company, ZESPRI was looking at opportunities to lower its environmental impact and looking for innovative solutions. They expressed interest in working with us on developing solutions.\nAn important group also was our customers. Global retailers were looking for innovative solutions to how we provide our product into the market, and one of the important areas for global customers is waste streams associated with packaging materials.

The program implements a `parentProxy` object using the Proxy API. The `parentProxy` object is used to create a chain of queued functions that are executed asynchronously. You need to understand the behavior of the code snippet and implement a specific feature for the `parentProxy`.\n\nThe code snippet shows a global variable `parentQueuedFnChain` initialized as an empty array. The `parentProxy` object is created using the `new Proxy` constructor, which takes two arguments: `subtarget` and a handler object.\n\nThe handler object has an `apply` method that is called when a function is invoked on the `parentProxy`. The `apply` method takes three arguments: `subtarget`, `thisArg`, and `args`. In this case, `subtarget` is a callback function.\n\nInside the `apply` method, there is a conditional check to see if `errForStackGen` is an instance of `Error`. If not, it creates a new `Error` object and assigns it to `errForStackGen`.\n\nThe `apply` method then returns a new Promise. Within this Promise, there is a reference to `errForStackGen` stored locally as `localErrForStack`. Finally, `errForStackGen` is reset to `null` for the next immediate use.\n\nYour task is to implement a feature that allows calling a `queue` function on the `parentProxy` object. The `queue` function should take a callback function as an argument and push it to the `parentQueuedFnChain` array.
