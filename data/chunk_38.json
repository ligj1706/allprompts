Primarily, our interests lie in the neural collapse (NC) phenomena (Papyan et. al 2020) where the last layer representations (embeddings) and the weights of the classification head align and form an equiangular tight frame (ETF) structure. The NC phenomena was first characterized and analyzed for neural networks optimized with Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss. However, recent work has shown that the ETF structure is the optimal geometry for SCL (Graf et al. 2021). Our hope is to fill in the gaps by approaching the problem from an optimization perspective. With this, we see potential in characterizing the geometry once again as an ETF but in addition we will analyze the data-imbalanced setting akin to what was recently accomplished for CE (Thrampoulidis et al. 2022). This approach has a few advantages: (a) we would be able to apply an established optimization framework in order to further understand SCL; (b) it offers the potential to explore modified geometries due to added constraints, such as those imposed by some modern neural networks. Modern deep learning has been moving towards larger models like Transformers trained via unsupervised means, furthermore, recent works have suggested an increased robustness to distributional imbalances in this setting. This work provides a stepping stone in understanding the implicit geometry of unsupervised settings through understanding self-similarity metrics like SCL which are at the core of unsupervised learning."}, {"id": 5702, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "brainstorm 10 ideas for paper topics related to Shakespeare's king lear"}, {"id": 5703, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "Code for a web view link to detect OS and redirect to mobile app installed"}, {"id": 5704, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write an essay in which you reflect on a moment in your life when you had to make a difficult sacrifice for someone you loved.

The code snippet shows a conditional statement that determines whether to turn off the AC based on certain conditions.\n\nYour task is to implement a function, `should_turn_off_ac`, that takes in two parameters:\n1. `now` (integer): the current time in seconds elapsed since a reference timestamp.\n2. `alarm_start` (integer): the time in seconds elapsed since the reference timestamp when the alarm was started.\n\nThe reference timestamp is a fixed point in time against which the `now` and `alarm_start` times are measured.\n\nThe function should return a boolean value indicating whether the AC system should be turned off. The rules for turning off the AC are as follows:\n\n- If the time elapsed between the `alarm_start` and the `now` is greater than the threshold value `MIN_TIME_TURN_OFF_AC` (a constant), the AC should be turned off, regardless of any other conditions.\n\n- If the elapsed time is not greater than the threshold, but the `critical_alarm_state` is `True`, meaning the AC system is currently in a critical alarm state, the AC should be turned off.\n\n- If neither of the above conditions is met, the AC should remain on.\n\nImplement the function `should_turn_off_ac(now: int, alarm_start: int) -> bool` to solve the problem. Assume that `MIN_TIME_TURN_OFF_AC` and `critical_alarm_state` are accessible variables within the program but are not parameters of the `should_turn_off_ac` function.\n\nYou can assume that the input values for `now` and `alarm_start` are always non-negative integers.\n\nExample:\n```\nMIN_TIME_TURN_OFF_AC = 1800\ncritical_alarm_state = False\n\nassert should_turn_off_ac(3600, 900) == True\nassert should_turn_off_ac(900, 900) == False\nassert should_turn_off_ac(1800, 900) == False\nassert should_turn_off_ac(1800, 1800) == False\nassert should_turn_off_ac(2700, 900) == False\n```"}, {"id": 5707, "actor": "Generative Art & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "show python code examples using slack conversations.replies"}, {"id": 5708, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "a species that has an essential role in maintaining ecosystem structure is called a"}, {"id": 5709, "actor": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "prompt": "Please provide a JSON data with the names of 5 famous fashion designers.\nRewritten prompt:\nI need a list of 5 famous fashion designers in JSON format.

According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\nA: Lucas has a total of 12 existing pet beds + 8 new pet beds = 20 pet beds.

If each kid waits 2 minutes for the swings and 15 seconds for the slide, how many seconds shorter is the shorter wait?\nAnswer: First find the total wait time for the swings in minutes: 3 kids * 2 minutes / kid = 6 minutes. Then convert that number to seconds: 6 minutes * 60 seconds / minute = 360 seconds. Then find the total number of kids waiting for the slide: 3 kids * 2 = 6 kids. Then find the total wait time for the slide: 15 seconds / kid * 6 kids = 90 seconds. Then subtract the total wait for the slide from the total wait for the swings to find the difference: 360 seconds - 90 seconds = 270 seconds. The answer is 270.\n[Question]Betsy is sewing a quilt.

Additionally, how does the use of videos on product pages impact the conversion rate? Please provide a detailed analysis with examples.\nAssuming a company wants to increase its e-commerce sales, it may be important to consider the loading speed of their website as a factor that can impact conversion rates. A slow-loading website can lead to frustration and decreased engagement, ultimately resulting in fewer sales. However, it is also important to consider the impact of website design on conversion rates. A visually appealing and user-friendly design can lead to increased engagement and ultimately more sales.\nIn addition to website speed and design, the use of videos on product pages can also impact conversion rates. Videos can provide a more in-depth look at products, helping to build trust and potentially leading to increased sales. However, the use of videos can also increase website loading times, potentially leading to decreased engagement and fewer sales.\nIt is important for companies to carefully analyze the impact of website loading speed, design, and the use of videos on conversion rates before making decisions.
