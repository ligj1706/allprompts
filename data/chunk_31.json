Within a short period of time, nasty critters that no one wants on their property often make these vehicles their homes. If you haven’t been able to sell your old car to a dealership or private party, then here is a look at some unique ways you can take care of the eyesore.\nOne of the best ways to make money off of a car that is no longer in driving condition is to sell individual parts. Even relatively insignificant pieces can be worth quite a bit if you know where to look. Before selling any pieces, you should first spend some time researching the vehicle to better understand its value. Many older cars have interchangeable components, and some of your car’s parts might be worth a lot of money to someone who is restoring another classic vehicle.\nMany drivers don’t realize that nearly 100 percent of all automobiles in the United States eventually get recycled. While that statistic is quite impressive, a vehicle that sits for a long period of time can still do quite a bit of damage to the environment. Many metal recycling companies will come pick up old cars at little or no cost to their owners. After your vehicle is towed away, you can rest assured that almost every single piece will be put to good use.\nAnother great way to make the most out of your old clunker is to donate it to charity through an organization, like Action Donation Services. Not only is it going to a good cause, but you will most likely also receive a tax break. Some intermediary companies even fix up old vehicles so that the old owners can write off as much as possible. Just like metal recycling companies, most charities and intermediary organizations will come pick up your vehicle for free.\nThose who have the right tools and some spare time can generally make at least a little bit of money off of their old clunkers. A small percentage of classic car enthusiasts try to completely restore their vehicles, but that isn’t always necessary. If all of the major mechanical components work, then you will most likely be able to sell your old car. Cosmetic updates such as a new paint job or rims aren’t always worth the investment.\nNo matter what you end up doing with your clunker, it is generally a good idea to take care of these types of problems sooner rather than later. In addition to being the perfect home for pest infestations, parked vehicles often end up leaking oil, coolant, and other harsh chemicals. What started off as a minor issue could end up being a serious hazard to your family and neighbors.\nWhat is the importance of researching the value of your car's parts before selling them?"}, {"id": 31069, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "Can you create a comma separated pin list for the part ADP1763ACPZ-1.0-R7 from Analog Devices?

Computer architects use simulation to assess different design options, test new research ideas and analyse the performance/power consumption of different processor models. 2. Analytical models are not suitable for evaluating architectural/micro-architectural designs and design variations as they produce inaccurate results because of the huge amount of configurations and small details that can cause small variations in performance. 3. Simulation is considered to be the standard performance modelling method. 4. The majority of published research is based on the use of simulators to analyse the performance of new ideas. 5. Many computer architecture simulators support various instruction set architectures (ISAs), microarchitectures and are based on different simulation models ranging from trace-based to cycle-accurate. 6. It can be a daunting task for new researchers in the area of computer architecture and systems, to choose one simulator and start their research. 7. In addition, in order to have a trust in simulation studies, simulation results need to be validated. 8. This can be challenging, especially when there is not enough documentation about simulators. 9. There is little work that evaluates current computer architecture simulators, performs a comparison among them, and/or compares their accuracy to contemporary processors.\n\n10. In computer architecture, the main goal of simulation is to model new research ideas for parts of a computer system (e.g. microprocessor, memory, IO devices) or a complete computer system and estimate the performance improvements and/or power consumption. 11. Simulators also help computer architects in evaluating, debugging and understanding the behaviour of existing systems. 12. In simulation terminology, a computer system that is being simulated is called a target, and the system where the simulation is run is called a host. 13. Workloads that run on simulators can be standard test programs, known as benchmarks, which are run to assess the performance of a processor or a computer. 14. The workload being simulated can also be an operating system (OS), sometimes referred to as a guest OS. 15. The interaction between a simulator and a host system is shown in Figure 1. 16. This survey is a more comprehensive and an updated survey compared to previous existing surveys, which either focused on teaching related simulators, memory simulators, or were not much detailed. 17. In this survey, we compare the simulators' results with that of real hardware experiments to measure their inaccuracies. 18. The paper does not cover systems on chip (SoC) simulators, although many of the simulators that are discussed are capable of simulating embedded processors.\n19.

The presentation included current litigation issues and advertising tactics. As senior partner and presenter Gil Purcell stated early in his presentation, the goal was to share information and educate members of the ALA about the existing problems with tobacco and challenges tobacco litigation faces in the courts.\nOne of the overriding challenges facing tobacco litigation is defining an \"injury\" and how it relates to a potential case's statute of limitations. Mr. Purcell explained the procedural defense used by the tobacco industry and the current challenge before the courts to decide what qualifies as a tobacco injury.\n\"What is Truth to One is False to Another\"\nTo combat a rising wave of concern over the safety and negative health effects of cigarette use, in 1954 the Tobacco Industry Research Committee issued \"A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\" calling into question the theory that smoking is linked to lung cancer in humans. The \"Frank Statement\" kicked off the tobacco industries misinformation and no limits advertising tactics. Throughout Mr. Purcell's presentation, examples of tobacco advertising were displayed--examples of the reach that tobacco once had into our lives.\nInternal company documents showed a calculated interest in appealing to and recruiting new smokers before they were of age to smoke. Methods used by the tobacco industry included distributing misinformation, advertising in television shows geared towards young viewers and utilizing social icons to promote the acceptance of smoking.\nThe deceit aimed towards youth was not limited to advertisements--tobacco companies showed no restraint in their desire to recruit new smokers. Mr. Purcell showed a 1963 letter from R.J. Reynolds addressing questions asked by a fourth grade class about the safety of tobacco, which claimed, \"...medical science has been unable to establish that smoking has a direct causal link with any human disease.\"\nA common theme encapsulated Mr. Purcell's presentation, through carefully planned and executed legal maneuvers, the tobacco industry has been able to continue to sell a dangerous product to the public with no responsibility to the people that they knowingly injure. Through the work of Brayton Purcell and the American Lung Association, the public will have advocates fighting to bring them the truth about the tobacco industry and their dangerous products.\nHow is Brayton Purcell LLP and the American Lung Association working to educate the public about the truth behind the tobacco industry and their products?"}, {"id": 31137, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "If Mable was alive at 9am and at 5pm, was she alive at noon?"}, {"id": 31138, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "Can undemocratic processes be enforced by democratic decisions?"}, {"id": 31139, "actor": "Mathematics & Algebra", "prompt": "Devise a real-world scenario where the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be applied to analyze stability."}, {"id": 31140, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "Served to give me information and knowledge about the biometric KYC OCR identity verification system in the app. When the photo is taken, what kind of file can be sent to the system"}, {"id": 31141, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet from a Python module **blvnet_tam.py** that imports a class **bLVNet_TAM** and exports it using the variable **__all__**.\n\nYour task is to implement the missing code for the class **bLVNet_TAM** based on the following specifications:\n\nThe **bLVNet_TAM** class should inherit from a base class called **BaseTAM**.

Pete has been involved in a number of various energy projects over the years and he and I share an interest in antique heavy equipment (this is where I met him). After our meeting, Pete summarized our discussions - see his email below. I'm sharing this with you because in a way, Pete's email forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R. He captured the main topics we discussed but we need to separate those major topics into their own \"stand alone\" business plans. \n\nFor now considering your present assignment, let's focus on utility work in the USA only. We can look at the other items later on. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Alan and I developed a budget identifying the \"cost of doing business\" should we move to Texas or California. This summarizes the expenditures we'd expect such as personnel salaries, office rental, vehicles, etc. We did a three year forecast of these costs to see how much money we would need to operate a company down in the USA. This was a rather \"crude\" estimate in that all we did was multiply the rate or cost of an item by the number of units or hours. With respect to the number of hours that a person would contribute, we simply assumed two categories. One is where a person would have full time involvement and therefore would consume 2,080 hours, which is considered to be standard work year (40 hours a week x 52 weeks a year). The other is where they would have part-time involvement and in this case, we assumed they would only work half a year or 1,040 hours. Given more time, we need to refine this estimate a bit more. The main purpose of this budget was to seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan so we were \"conservative\" in our numbers in this estimate. In reality, our actual costs would likely be less but for the purposes of this budget (where we were seeking as much money as we could get), we went slightly overboard with our numbers.\n\nKnowing our costs, we now need to figure out how much revenue we could earn. How we earn revenue is by undertaking projects. So, what I asked Steven to do initially was some desktop research to identify potential projects in the Texas market that we'd be qualified to bid on - specifically, high voltage transmission line work. These could be found by searching various local utility websites. I think there are maybe six major utilities in Texas - like AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor Electric, Texas - New Mexico Power, etc. Projects should be listed on these (or similar) websites along with other information such as schedule (when they are expected to be built), estimated value, etc. After you collect this information, we'll then summarize it on a spreadsheet and assess the value of what we expect our portion of this work would be.\n\nAfter you gather all this information on the spreadsheet, we'll have what we need to complete our business plan and answer the questions Pete asks in his email. And from your research, we'll assume that we earn $X million in revenue per year less $Y million in expenses and the balance should be a positive number that represents our profit.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nFor now, just see what you can do by identifying potential clients (utility companies) in Texas, their project list, the value of these projects and when they're expected to be built. With the information you provide, I'll do a draft of our business plan and share it with you so you can see how your work contributed to our plan.\n\nBest of luck and if you have any questions, please ask.\n\nAll the best!\n\nBill"}, {"id": 31215, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Compare and contrast fiction and non-fiction."}, {"id": 31216, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "You are tasked with generating Y lines of text using a random generator.

At the end, you will also produce an FAQ, save Question and Answers from each part to a document called \"QnA\".\n\nTo help you create headings for the wiki article I've provided the agenda for the session as a suggestion.\n\nIntroduction\nWhy was Cross Workspace Collaboration created?\nUnderstanding Guest User Feature\nUnderstanding Cross Workspace Collaboration Feature\nKey Differences Between Guest User and Cross Workspace Collaboration Features\nPricing and plans\nTips for Suggesting the Right Feature to Customers\n\nI will provide the transcript in separate parts, here's the first part: \n\n\"\nJoe Fleming: And do we have everybody? Yeah, Shane is out right? Got it. And yeah, we have okay cool fantastic. So Yeah, so I'll just quickly kick off the session. So the purpose of the session today is, as you guys all know, we launched fellow 4.1 Fellow 4.1 comes with a whole bunch of new features. One of those features which is like a pretty big deal. Actually is crocs Cross Workspace, collaboration xwc for short, and it's exciting for a whole bunch of different reasons. One of them just to you guys know, is that it's like, it's a huge way to get more customers because if you think about it,\nJoe Fleming: Right before the guest user fellow and that's great. But the guest users don't have fellow workspaces so they don't pick you. Well, we don't email them. None of this stuff happens. And as you guys have experienced, It's crazy. Some of the things people use fellow for if they're like project managers or contractors or agencies they meet with lots of customers. And they have them always as guests and we never get access to these companies. So now there is an option for those companies to have fellow. And to use fellow with another company that is also using fellow. So, It could be huge for us.\nJoe Fleming: The butt. That the big reason for the session today is to figure out, Because crossword space collaboration has a lot of overlap with guest user.\nJoe Fleming: Training both. When should we pitch one or the other? What are some of the considerations? And we also want to turn this into documentation afterwards, so, That's the other reason for the format. So we there are a couple of things that we'll ask from everybody just to follow a certain format for the session. So you do have a question Just say, Hey, I have a question. Beforehand, which will make it easier for us to pick up that a question was asked inside of the transcript in, the AI will be able to figure it out and we'll build a nice FAQ afterwards from it. And then if you're answering you can say, Hey, you know, Here's an answer. I know it's gonna sound a little stupid and not as natural but try it out, I think it will really help.\nJoe Fleming: And we will also read some of the prompts. He the conversation structured. So that like afterwards we know like this section was about answering this big picture question. Okay. So yeah, Dom\nDominic Jean-Couture: Hey I have a question. I don't know if this is going to be covered but if it if it wasn't going to could we make sure to cover how this might influence\nJoe Fleming: Yes, we absolutely can. Yeah and it we actually have it in one of the sections. Fantastic. Okay, so we covered the intro. I just generated the whole like agenda so I guess I we can talk about this problem just so like kick things off. I am curious to get everyone's take on like your experience with the guest user collaboration feature. So like maybe we can just quickly talk about like, Is everybody like has everybody tried or used The Crossword Space Collaboration feature? Has anybody used it on the sales team?\nAustin Bukovec: not used it, but\nMarcus de Verteuil: Use it for kickoff.\nSarah Collins: Yeah.\nJoe Fleming: Kickoffs. Yeah.\nMarcus de Verteuil: It's thick. Yeah, I love it. Because like, you could just like, Like you can like dish off like all those steps. for like champions, like Hey, I need to fill out this sheet of users for Masterclass. It's pretty cool. You can assign it to the guy and then even link the the sheet and I just like, woke up to a bunch of comments from the champion and it's just like I filled it out. Marcus, make sure you know, can you can you confirm that? They'll be availability next week and like it's nice it happens instantaneously. You can like check them off and and if keep them accountable and Yeah, and they get to experience it as well. So that's the only time I've used it. I think it's really good for that.\n00:05:00\nMarcus de Verteuil: That's the only time.\nJoe Fleming: Cool. That is definitely use case, right? Cool. And then, Let's see, let's go through because I know, we, we will cover some of these items. So, do we talk? We haven't like clearly talked about why crossword space collaboration was created. Sarah mean, do you want to? Do you want to maybe just briefly go over that?\nSarah Collins: Yeah, the answer to why crossword space collaboration was created was because we were looking for a way to do a few different things. One, we wanted a way to increase virality for fellow As Joe already touched upon two. We wanted to simplify the experience for customers especially ones that already have an existing fellow account. So, the product team actually did an analysis and what the analysis showed was that there is about 50 workspaces that had guest users, where those guests had an existing fellow workspace. So this is how we knew that there is demand for a future like this. And then for implementation and for CSM, One thing, we were looking on, at was having the ability to collaborate with our users on the kickoff, on different account plans, all of that, great stuff.\nSarah Collins: So for regular CSM tools, you have the ability to do that. So for example, with Jiminy, we have a tool, I think they use games and we use that to house our account plan for Jiminy and then they can see how they check things off. We collaborate so this can provide that same experience but using fellow which is really cool.\n\""}, {"id": 31225, "actor": "Job Application & Customer Management", "prompt": "Write me a recommendation letter for a student applying to an internship.

This resulted in broad public concern and calls for immediate action by policymakers. Understanding how interest rates affect the rent in Israel will be essential for treating this crisis and developing effective policy measures in particular in the current period where there have been significant changes in the central bank interest rates. Our research question deals with the influence of interest rates on rent in Israel and is of the utmost importance for a number of reasons.\nFirst, the housing market is a critical component of the local economy as it affects the housing market as well as other areas such as construction, financial and consumer expenses. A stable housing market is essential to promote the economic growth and stability of the economy.\nSecond, the Israeli economy depends largely on global macroeconomic conditions, and changes in interest rates a significant impact on the state's substantive economic metrics. Understanding the relationship between interest and rent changes will be crucial in the development of monetary policy that can stabilize the economy and provide the impact of economic fluctuations on the housing market.\nThird, for changes in the rental market, there is considerable impact on different layers in the population, such as low -income tenants and first apartment buyers. For example, an increase in rental prices may make it difficult for low -income rents to fund the rent, thus endangering their economic stability. On the other hand, a decrease in rental prices can lead to a decline in rental assets, which may adversely affect the value of the property owners 'assets and even impair the quality of the property for rent, as the right -wingers' willingness to invest in maintenance will be lower when the rent received from the property will be lower.\nWe will conclude that this policy question is greatly relevant in public discourse and the current economic climate, with higher interest rates than it has been in over the past 10 years. Examining the impact of interest changes on rent in Israel will provide valuable insights into policymakers as they are navigated in the current economic environment and make decisions that will design the future of economics and housing market in the country.\n \nPlease add a reference to each of the three claims we wrote on the subject of research"}, {"id": 31302, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "What do you think about the role societal norms play in shaping our values?

I would like you're help building a slack app that sends job failure and success notifications. I found a lot of documentation on the topic, can I provide you this information over a series of messages? Here's the first instructions, below. When you are ready for more, respond OK.\n\nCreating Slack Messages from Platform\nAvatar Tori Becker\nUpdated 1 year ago\nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nClick on the workspace dropdown in the top left of Slack, and select “Customize [Workspace name]”:\n\nmceclip0.png\n\n \n\nThis will take you to the web browser of Slack. Click “Menu” in the top left corner, followed by “Configure apps”: \n\nmceclip1.png\n \n\nThat will take you to the Slack App Directory. Then click “Build” in the main toolbar:\n\nmceclip2.png\n\n \n\nClick “Create New App”. It's common for the app to have to be approved by the Slack administrator at your organization:\n\nmceclip3.png\n\n\nYou’ll now be prompted to follow a series of set up steps. You should follow the Slack documentation to get to the level of access you’ll need for your given use case. Here are some help docs that helped us as we made this: \n\nhttps://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#calling\nhttps://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts#attachments\n \n \n\nIf you’re planning to use the Platform to Slack script template in part 3, you’ll need the Slack app to at least have the following features and functionalities added (screenshot below), as well as the specific OAuth scopes (Slack’s term for permissions), found under “Permissions”:\n\nmceclip4.png\n\n \n\nmceclip5.png\n\n \n\nNote: the OAuth Scopes in Slack have great descriptions, as shown above. Use those to determine if you need to add additional scopes for your use case. You can also use incoming-webhooks to create messages from Google Forms, etc. \n\n\nOnce the scopes have been added, it’s time to request your app be installed by your administrator. This will allow you to get the OAuth token you’ll need to make a Platform credential. You can do this in the “OAuth & Permissions” page of your app, click “Request to Install”: \n\nmceclip6.png\n\nOnce your admin approves of the app, Slack will alert you by sending a Slackbot message like this: \n\nmceclip7.png\n\nNow, you should be able to see an OAuth token that’s been generated for your app. This is blocked out in the below screenshot for security purposes but you should see a long password value in this field that you can copy: \n\nmceclip8.png\n\nLastly, make sure to add the app to the channels you want it to write to in Slack. You can do so by opening the Slack channel details, clicking “Integrations”, and clicking “Add apps”: \n\nmceclip10.png\n\n \n\n \n\nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nNow, it’s time to store your Slack OAuth in Platform. You can follow these instructions for generic credential creation. \n\n \n\n“Name” will be what’s displayed in Platform, so pick something intuitive. \n“Type” should be “Custom”. \n“Username” can be anything, but cannot be blank. \n“Password” will be the OAuth Token displayed by Slack in the screenshot above. \n“Remote host” should be left blank. \nmceclip11.png\n\nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \n \n\nCreate a new script from this template. If you are not shared on template 178902, please contact support@civisanalytics.com . \n\n“Credential” should be the Platform credential created in step 2. \n“Channel” should be the Slack channel you wish to write to. \n“Text” should be the text you wish to post. For emojis, links, or mentions, please check this Slack documentation for the proper syntax i.e. :heavy\\_check\\_mark: for ✔️or for @here \nRun your job and expect the text to be posted in the designated channel like so:mceclip0.png\n\nPro tip: include this job at the end of a workflow."}, {"id": 31489, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet that involves a conditional statement and variable assignments.

If convicted, he could face 10 years in prison.

Indian. Walking,” he said, according to his son Chirag’s statement to the local media at the time.

The edge used to be a place where these devices connected so they could deliver data to, and receive instructions and download software updates from a centrally located data center or the cloud. Now with the explosion of the Internet of Things, that model has shortcomings. IoT devices gather so much data that the sheer volume requires larger and more expensive connections to data centers and the cloud. The nature of the work performed by these IoT devices is also creating a need for much faster connections between the data center or cloud and the devices. For example, if sensors in valves at a petroleum refinery detect dangerously high pressure in the pipes, shutoffs need to be triggered as soon as possible. With analysis of that pressure data taking place at distant processing centers, the automatic shutoff instructions may come too late. But with processing power placed local to the end devices, latency is less, and that roundtrip time can be significantly reduced, potentially saving downtime, damage to property and even lives. Even with the introduction of edge devices that provide local computing and storage, there will still be a need to connect them to data centers, whether they are on premises or in the cloud. For example, temperature and humidity sensors in agricultural fields gather valuable data, but that data doesn’t have to be analyzed or stored in real time. Edge devices can collect, sort and perform preliminary analysis of the data, then send it along to where it needs to go: to centralized applications or some form of long-term storage, again either on-prem or in the cloud. Because this traffic may not be time-sensitive, slower, less expensive connections – possibly over the internet – can be used. And because the data is presorted, the volume of traffic that needs to be sent at all may be reduced. So the upside of edge computing is faster response time for applications that require it and slowing the growth of expensive long-haul connections to processing and storage centers. The downside can be security. With data being collected and analyzed at the edge, it’s important to include security for the IoT devices that connect to the edge devices and for the edge devices themselves. They contains valuable data, but they are also network elements that, if exploited, could compromise other devices that contain stores of valuable assets. With edge computing becoming more essential, it’s also important to make sure that the edge devices themselves don’t become a single point of failure. Network architects need to build in redundancy and provide failover contingencies in order to avoid crippling downtime if a primary node goes down. The industry has already gone a long way toward addressing the demands of edge computing, and it is becoming mainstream. Its importance is likely to grow even more as the use of real-time applications becomes more prevalent.\""}, {"id": 31691, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "What are the traditional songs sung during the Carnevale di Venezia in Italy?"}, {"id": 31692, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "write sample airflow code to load data from salesforce and store it in S3 in .parquet format"}, {"id": 31693, "actor": "SEO & Content Marketing", "prompt": "Chiffrement de Vigenere\n\nPlease write in English language.Share Prompt"}, {"id": 31694, "actor": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "prompt": "How do I write a SQL query to get a list of users on everyday by their active status over last 28 days?"}, {"id": 31695, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "As a detective, you are investigating a case of theft.

I think this can depend on a lot of different factors; for example, somebody starting a job might have different needs and priorities compared to a person who intends to go on and study at university. Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or something similar.\n\nFirst of all, it’s important to consider finances. Certainly, it is possible for some young adults to get work and support themselves relatively quickly. However, in most parts of the world these days it costs a lot to rent a house, attend university, buy a car or purchase things like insurance. By way of example, I can recall trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggle to pay bills and meet all the other costs of living as a young adult. This in turn had adverse effects for things like my study performance.\n\nIn addition to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential. With your family’s support, it is a lot easier to focus on your studies. Of course, for some people in some situations, the family situation may actually be quite distracting or stressful. However I think it would be fair to say that for most people, you are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night’s sleep if you happen to be living in the family home. I can recall a friend from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn’t eat or study well and inevitably his grades suffered. He had to repeat several subjects and finished his degree later than many of his peers.\n\nFinally, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence. I’ll be the first to admit that there are parents out there who struggle to acknowledge that their children have grown up and deserve treatment as adults; it’s instinctive in many of them to continue pay a ‘mothering’ role that can be quite stifling for a young adult. Despite this possibility, even though I spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respected me as an adult as well as their child and they didn’t attempt to interfere too much or limit my independence. I think this is the case for many young people as well, so I don’t think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy the benefits of independence. In fact, I believe the safe environment of the family is a good place to handle the transition to adulthood for all concerned, both the child and the parents.\n\nBy way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for a longer period of time. Families are precious things and an essential part of the fabric of a nurturing society, so I have a strong belief that they can be a powerful guide in helping children negotiate the path to independence."}, {"id": 31797, "actor": "Basketball Strategy & Educational Response Generation", "prompt": "Describe Burial's music, and provide a few artists who sound similarly"}, {"id": 31798, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "[QUESTION] Premise: \"Three people stand on a basketball court as a ball flies through the air.\"\nHypothesis: \"Four people are running on a soccer field.\"\nDo we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\nIts either three or four people.

It takes 5 miles of cable to electrify 1 mile of street. If cable costs $2000/mile, what is the total cost of cable for the neighborhood?\nLet's think: First find the total distance of the east - west streets: 18 streets * 2 miles / street = 36 miles. Then find the total distance of the north - south streets: 10 streets * 4 miles / street = 40 miles. Then add the number of miles from each type of street to find the total distance: 36 miles + 40 miles = 76 miles. Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of miles of cable needed: 76 miles street * 5 miles cable / mile street = 380 miles of cable. Then multiply that number by the cost of one mile of cable to find the total cost: 380 miles * $2000 / mile = $760,000..

Kenny and Judson contributed a total of $600 + $500 = $1100. If Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny, then he contributed $600 + $200 = $800.

Period.\n6:23\nWe've learned three big lessons about relationships.\n6:26\nThe first is that social connections are really good for us,\n6:30\nand that loneliness kills.\n6:33\nIt turns out that people who are more socially connected\n6:37\nto family, to friends, to community,\n6:40\nare happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer\n6:45\nthan people who are less well connected.\n6:48\nAnd the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.\n6:51\nPeople who are more isolated than they want to be from others\n6:57\nfind that they are less happy,\n7:00\ntheir health declines earlier in midlife,\n7:03\ntheir brain functioning declines sooner\n7:05\nand they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.\n7:10\nAnd the sad fact is that at any given time,\n7:13\nmore than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.\n7:19\nAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd\n7:21\nand you can be lonely in a marriage,\n7:24\nso the second big lesson that we learned\n7:26\nis that it's not just the number of friends you have,\n7:29\nand it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,\n7:33\nbut it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.\n7:38\nIt turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.\n7:43\nHigh-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,\n7:47\nturn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.\n7:53\nAnd living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.\n7:57\nOnce we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,\n8:01\nwe wanted to look back at them at midlife\n8:04\nand to see if we could predict\n8:05\nwho was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian\n8:09\nand who wasn't.\n8:11\nAnd when we gathered together everything we knew about them\n8:15\nat age 50,\n8:18\nit wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels\n8:20\nthat predicted how they were going to grow old.\n8:23\nIt was how satisfied they were in their relationships.\n8:27\nThe people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50\n8:31\nwere the healthiest at age 80.\n8:35\nAnd good, close relationships seem to buffer us\n8:38\nfrom some of the slings and arrows of getting old.\n8:42\nOur most happily partnered men and women\n8:46\nreported, in their 80s,\n8:48\nthat on the days when they had more physical pain,\n8:51\ntheir mood stayed just as happy.\n8:54\nBut the people who were in unhappy relationships,\n8:57\non the days when they reported more physical pain,\n9:00\nit was magnified by more emotional pain.\n9:04\nAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health\n9:08\nis that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,\n9:12\nthey protect our brains.\n9:14\nIt turns out that being in a securely attached relationship\n9:19\nto another person in your 80s is protective,\n9:23\nthat the people who are in relationships\n9:25\nwhere they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,\n9:29\nthose people's memories stay sharper longer.\n9:32\nAnd the people in relationships\n9:34\nwhere they feel they really can't count on the other one,\n9:37\nthose are the people who experience earlier memory decline.\n9:42\nAnd those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.\n9:46\nSome of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other\n9:49\nday in and day out,\n9:51\nbut as long as they felt that they could really count on the other\n9:54\nwhen the going got tough,\n9:56\nthose arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.\n10:01\nSo this message,\n10:04\nthat good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,\n10:10\nthis is wisdom that's as old as the hills.\n10:13\nWhy is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?\n10:17\nWell, we're human.\n10:19\nWhat we'd really like is a quick fix,\n10:21\nsomething we can get\n10:23\nthat'll make our lives good and keep them that way.\n10:27\nRelationships are messy and they're complicated\n10:30\nand the hard work of tending to family and friends,\n10:34\nit's not sexy or glamorous.\n10:37\nIt's also lifelong. It never ends.\n10:40\nThe people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement\n10:45\nwere the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.\n10:51\nJust like the millennials in that recent survey,\n10:54\nmany of our men when they were starting out as young adults\n10:58\nreally believed that fame and wealth and high achievement\n11:02\nwere what they needed to go after to have a good life.\n11:06\nBut over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown\n11:10\nthat the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,\n11:16\nwith family, with friends, with community.\n11:21\nSo what about you?\n11:23\nLet's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.\n11:27\nWhat might leaning in to relationships even look like?\n11:31\nWell, the possibilities are practically endless.\n11:35\nIt might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time\n11:41\nor livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,\n11:46\nlong walks or date nights,\n11:49\nor reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,\n11:54\nbecause those all-too-common family feuds\n11:57\ntake a terrible toll\n12:00\non the people who hold the grudges.\n12:04\nI'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.\n12:09\nMore than a century ago,\n12:11\nhe was looking back on his life,\n12:14\nand he wrote this:\n12:16\n\"There isn't time, so brief is life,\n12:20\nfor bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.\n12:26\nThere is only time for loving,\n12:29\nand but an instant, so to speak, for that.\"\n12:34\nThe good life is built with good relationships.\n12:39\nThank you."}, {"id": 31854, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "Compare and contrast the following two equations using the [Cramer's rule] formula:\nx + 2y = 7\n2x + 4y = 14\nExplain the similarities and differences between the two equations in terms of their coefficients and variables.

[1]  An embassy is responsible for representing the home country, handling major diplomatic issues, and preserving the rights of its citizens abroad. [2]  The ambassador is the highest official in the embassy and acts as the chief diplomat and spokesperson for the home government. [2]  Usually, if a country recognizes another as being sovereign, an embassy is established to maintain foreign relations and provide assistance to traveling citizens. [2]\n\nBy contrast, a consulate is a smaller version of an embassy and is generally located in the larger tourist cities of a country, but not the capital. [2]  A consulate is essentially a satellite office of the embassy, but its roles are limited in scope, usually pertaining to and prioritizing the interests and concerns of its people and businesses abroad. [4]\nB: The difference between an embassy and a consulate is that an embassy is the main location for a diplomatic presence of one country in another, and a consulate is a smaller version of an embassy and is generally located in the larger tourist cities of a country, but not the capital [1,4]. \n\nEmbassies are the center for high-level government interactions, and play a role in major international relations, such as preparing treaties and arranging official state visits [4]. The head of an embassy is the ambassador, who is the official representative authorized to speak on behalf of the head of state of the country [4]. \n\nConsulates, while having the same official duties as embassies, usually operate as lesser branches that deal with more administrative issues [4]. The top priority of consulates is to generally assist citizens of the home country traveling or living abroad [4].

(2007). Effect of environment and time of planting on the production and quality of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) storage roots. New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science, 35(1), 107-116.\nThe tuberous root yields of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) were compared from field trials planted in September, October, and November at four sites (Pukekohe, Hamilton, Lincoln, Mosgiel) across New Zealand. The September plantings gave the highest yields at all sites, with the October plantings giving 17% less yield and the November plantings 61% less. The September planting at Hamilton produced the highest yield of 90 t/ha, Pukekohe 64 t/ha, Lincoln 22 t/ha, and Mosgiel 15 t/ha. Regression analysis established a strong positive relationship between dry root yield and accumulated growing degree days (GDD) below 10°C calculated for base temperatures 0, 6, and 8°C (R² = 0.87–0.88). Regression analysis R² values declined above 10°C. Dry root yields were high where heat accumulation was at least 1800 GDD8 for the growing season with c. 1 t/ha of dried roots being produced for every additional 100 GDD8 above 1200 degree days. This relationship helps to identify suitable production environments for yacon. Best root production also needs an undefined level of cool temperatures as at the warmest site crown production was favoured. Total fructo‐oligosaccharide (FOS) content of the yacon roots varied from 48.2% to 67.5%.
