Computer architects use simulation to assess different design options, test new research ideas and analyse the performance/power consumption of different processor models. 2. Analytical models are not suitable for evaluating architectural/micro-architectural designs and design variations as they produce inaccurate results because of the huge amount of configurations and small details that can cause small variations in performance. 3. Simulation is considered to be the standard performance modelling method. 4. The majority of published research is based on the use of simulators to analyse the performance of new ideas. 5. Many computer architecture simulators support various instruction set architectures (ISAs), microarchitectures and are based on different simulation models ranging from trace-based to cycle-accurate. 6. It can be a daunting task for new researchers in the area of computer architecture and systems, to choose one simulator and start their research. 7. In addition, in order to have a trust in simulation studies, simulation results need to be validated. 8. This can be challenging, especially when there is not enough documentation about simulators. 9. There is little work that evaluates current computer architecture simulators, performs a comparison among them, and/or compares their accuracy to contemporary processors.", "10. In computer architecture, the main goal of simulation is to model new research ideas for parts of a computer system (e.g. microprocessor, memory, IO devices) or a complete computer system and estimate the performance improvements and/or power consumption. 11. Simulators also help computer architects in evaluating, debugging and understanding the behaviour of existing systems. 12. In simulation terminology, a computer system that is being simulated is called a target, and the system where the simulation is run is called a host. 13. Workloads that run on simulators can be standard test programs, known as benchmarks, which are run to assess the performance of a processor or a computer. 14. The workload being simulated can also be an operating system (OS), sometimes referred to as a guest OS. 15. The interaction between a simulator and a host system is shown in Figure 1. 16. This survey is a more comprehensive and an updated survey compared to previous existing surveys, which either focused on teaching related simulators, memory simulators, or were not much detailed. 17. In this survey, we compare the simulators' results with that of real hardware experiments to measure their inaccuracies. 18.

Pete has been involved in a number of various energy projects over the years and he and I share an interest in antique heavy equipment (this is where I met him). After our meeting, Pete summarized our discussions - see his email below. I'm sharing this with you because in a way, Pete's email forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R. He captured the main topics we discussed but we need to separate those major topics into their own \"stand alone\" business plans.", "For now considering your present assignment, let's focus on utility work in the USA only. We can look at the other items later on.", "A couple of weeks ago, Alan and I developed a budget identifying the \"cost of doing business\" should we move to Texas or California. This summarizes the expenditures we'd expect such as personnel salaries, office rental, vehicles, etc. We did a three year forecast of these costs to see how much money we would need to operate a company down in the USA. This was a rather \"crude\" estimate in that all we did was multiply the rate or cost of an item by the number of units or hours. With respect to the number of hours that a person would contribute, we simply assumed two categories. One is where a person would have full time involvement and therefore would consume 2,080 hours, which is considered to be standard work year (40 hours a week x 52 weeks a year). The other is where they would have part-time involvement and in this case, we assumed they would only work half a year or 1,040 hours. Given more time, we need to refine this estimate a bit more. The main purpose of this budget was to seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan so we were \"conservative\" in our numbers in this estimate. In reality, our actual costs would likely be less but for the purposes of this budget (where we were seeking as much money as we could get), we went slightly overboard with our numbers.", "Knowing our costs, we now need to figure out how much revenue we could earn. How we earn revenue is by undertaking projects. So, what I asked Steven to do initially was some desktop research to identify potential projects in the Texas market that we'd be qualified to bid on - specifically, high voltage transmission line work. These could be found by searching various local utility websites. I think there are maybe six major utilities in Texas - like AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor Electric, Texas - New Mexico Power, etc. Projects should be listed on these (or similar) websites along with other information such as schedule (when they are expected to be built), estimated value, etc. After you collect this information, we'll then summarize it on a spreadsheet and assess the value of what we expect our portion of this work would be.", "After you gather all this information on the spreadsheet, we'll have what we need to complete our business plan and answer the questions Pete asks in his email. And from your research, we'll assume that we earn $X million in revenue per year less $Y million in expenses and the balance should be a positive number that represents our profit.", "I hope this makes sense.", "For now, just see what you can do by identifying potential clients (utility companies) in Texas, their project list, the value of these projects and when they're expected to be built.

The edge used to be a place where these devices connected so they could deliver data to, and receive instructions and download software updates from a centrally located data center or the cloud. Now with the explosion of the Internet of Things, that model has shortcomings. IoT devices gather so much data that the sheer volume requires larger and more expensive connections to data centers and the cloud. The nature of the work performed by these IoT devices is also creating a need for much faster connections between the data center or cloud and the devices. For example, if sensors in valves at a petroleum refinery detect dangerously high pressure in the pipes, shutoffs need to be triggered as soon as possible. With analysis of that pressure data taking place at distant processing centers, the automatic shutoff instructions may come too late. But with processing power placed local to the end devices, latency is less, and that roundtrip time can be significantly reduced, potentially saving downtime, damage to property and even lives. Even with the introduction of edge devices that provide local computing and storage, there will still be a need to connect them to data centers, whether they are on premises or in the cloud. For example, temperature and humidity sensors in agricultural fields gather valuable data, but that data doesn’t have to be analyzed or stored in real time. Edge devices can collect, sort and perform preliminary analysis of the data, then send it along to where it needs to go: to centralized applications or some form of long-term storage, again either on-prem or in the cloud. Because this traffic may not be time-sensitive, slower, less expensive connections – possibly over the internet – can be used. And because the data is presorted, the volume of traffic that needs to be sent at all may be reduced. So the upside of edge computing is faster response time for applications that require it and slowing the growth of expensive long-haul connections to processing and storage centers. The downside can be security. With data being collected and analyzed at the edge, it’s important to include security for the IoT devices that connect to the edge devices and for the edge devices themselves. They contains valuable data, but they are also network elements that, if exploited, could compromise other devices that contain stores of valuable assets. With edge computing becoming more essential, it’s also important to make sure that the edge devices themselves don’t become a single point of failure. Network architects need to build in redundancy and provide failover contingencies in order to avoid crippling downtime if a primary node goes down. The industry has already gone a long way toward addressing the demands of edge computing, and it is becoming mainstream. Its importance is likely to grow even more as the use of real-time applications becomes more prevalent.\""]}, {"id": 31691, "title": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "content": ["What are the traditional songs sung during the Carnevale di Venezia in Italy?"]}, {"id": 31692, "title": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "content": ["write sample airflow code to load data from salesforce and store it in S3 in .parquet format"]}, {"id": 31693, "title": "SEO & Content Marketing", "content": ["Chiffrement de Vigenere", "Please write in English language.Share Prompt"]}, {"id": 31694, "title": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "content": ["How do I write a SQL query to get a list of users on everyday by their active status over last 28 days?"]}, {"id": 31695, "title": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "content": ["As a detective, you are investigating a case of theft.

I think this can depend on a lot of different factors; for example, somebody starting a job might have different needs and priorities compared to a person who intends to go on and study at university. Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or something similar.", "First of all, it’s important to consider finances. Certainly, it is possible for some young adults to get work and support themselves relatively quickly. However, in most parts of the world these days it costs a lot to rent a house, attend university, buy a car or purchase things like insurance. By way of example, I can recall trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggle to pay bills and meet all the other costs of living as a young adult. This in turn had adverse effects for things like my study performance.", "In addition to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential. With your family’s support, it is a lot easier to focus on your studies. Of course, for some people in some situations, the family situation may actually be quite distracting or stressful. However I think it would be fair to say that for most people, you are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night’s sleep if you happen to be living in the family home. I can recall a friend from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn’t eat or study well and inevitably his grades suffered. He had to repeat several subjects and finished his degree later than many of his peers.", "Finally, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence. I’ll be the first to admit that there are parents out there who struggle to acknowledge that their children have grown up and deserve treatment as adults; it’s instinctive in many of them to continue pay a ‘mothering’ role that can be quite stifling for a young adult. Despite this possibility, even though I spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respected me as an adult as well as their child and they didn’t attempt to interfere too much or limit my independence. I think this is the case for many young people as well, so I don’t think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy the benefits of independence. In fact, I believe the safe environment of the family is a good place to handle the transition to adulthood for all concerned, both the child and the parents.", "By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for a longer period of time.

The September plantings gave the highest yields at all sites, with the October plantings giving 17% less yield and the November plantings 61% less. The September planting at Hamilton produced the highest yield of 90 t/ha, Pukekohe 64 t/ha, Lincoln 22 t/ha, and Mosgiel 15 t/ha. Regression analysis established a strong positive relationship between dry root yield and accumulated growing degree days (GDD) below 10°C calculated for base temperatures 0, 6, and 8°C (R² = 0.87–0.88). Regression analysis R² values declined above 10°C. Dry root yields were high where heat accumulation was at least 1800 GDD8 for the growing season with c. 1 t/ha of dried roots being produced for every additional 100 GDD8 above 1200 degree days. This relationship helps to identify suitable production environments for yacon. Best root production also needs an undefined level of cool temperatures as at the warmest site crown production was favoured. Total fructo‐oligosaccharide (FOS) content of the yacon roots varied from 48.2% to 67.5%. November yacon had the lowest FOS content and conversely the highest content of non‐FOS carbohydrates."]}, {"id": 31981, "title": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "content": ["Please tell me how to set up the project with the following items based on create react app", "react.js", "typescript", "eslint", "prettier", "tailwind", "react-query", "jest", "Answer in English.", "지금 번역하기"]}, {"id": 31982, "title": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "content": ["Have there been any sightings of Sasquatch in the past week?"]}, {"id": 31983, "title": "Legal & Government Affairs", "content": ["explain human hearing anatomy"]}, {"id": 31984, "title": "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "content": ["Explain the architecture and functionality of an artificial neural network using [Python code].
