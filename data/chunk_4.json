\"this is for you if you ever feel like you should be further ahead in life than what you are in right now and there are areas which are lagging no matter what you try and do you just can't seem to fix it this could be in terms of your energy this could be in terms of anxiety this could be in terms of your career you're not making the steps that you thought you would you're not making the money that you thought you would you're not being the dad the partner the husband that you wanted to be if you're just not showing up as the man that you you thought you would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you've probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can't seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I'll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I'm just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you're on what we call the hamster wheel right where you're constantly working your ass off but it feels like you're not really getting anywhere or you're not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you're at Square zero you're at Ground Zero you're just about to start your climb everything's totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you're the ultimate Dad this is where you're the ultimate partner or husband this is where you're making the money you're living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health's incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that's obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don't know what Summit they're actually climbing what is it that they're working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let's think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there's so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you've got money up here you've got you know drugs over here you've got women over on another one you've got whatever we've got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they're not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we're going to be totally unfilled and that's where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we're actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I'm old and gray and smelly and my Skin's all falling out and I've got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there's a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that's the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we're stuck here on the hamster wheel we're just going around and around and around and around in circles and we'll never actually make it up the mountain it'll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you've got no friction there's nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don't have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you're managing your stress really well you'll never evade stress completely in life but you'll know how to deal with it you're on point physically mentally and you're clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that's where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they're trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it's never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life's purpose which is essentially what your summit is it's the biggest climate you'll ever do in your life and it's permanent if you're trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you're never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you're feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we've got you here at base camp what do you need when you're at base camp you need this you need a map if you don't have a map you're never going to make it up the mountain I don't know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I've done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it's really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it's the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we're going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you're going to get there when you have those two things that is when you'll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you're playing not somebody else's game not society's game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it's the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you're at base camp that's when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you're not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you're going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who's going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I'll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\nVideo Summary:"}, {"id": 683, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a short story set in the 1920s, featuring a

After the siege and the assault had ceased at Troy, the city been\ndestroyed and burned to brands and ashes, the warrior who wrought\nthere the trains of treason was tried for his treachery, the truest on\nearth.1 This was Aeneas the noble; he and his high kindred afterwards\nconquered provinces, and became patrons of well nigh all the wealth in\nthe West Isles. As soon as rich Romulus turns him to Rome, with great\npride he at once builds that city, and names it with his own name, which\nit now has; Ticius turns to Tuscany and founds dwellings; Longobard\nraises homes in Lombardy; and, far over the French flood, Felix Brutus\nestablishes Britain joyfully on many broad banks, where war and waste\nand wonders by turns have since dwelt, and many a swift interchange of\nbliss and woe.\n2. And when this Britain was founded by this great hero, bold men\nloving strife bred therein, and many a time they wrought destruction.\nMore strange things have happened in this land since these days than in\nany other that I know, but of all the British kings that built here, Arthur\nwas ever the most courteous, as I have heard tell. Therefore, I mean to\ntell of an adventure in the world, which some count strange and\nextraordinary even among the wonders of Arthur. If ye will listen to this\nlay but a little while, I will tell it forthright as I heard it told in town, as\nit is set down in story that cannot be changed, long written in the land in\ntrue words.\n3. This King lay royally at Camelot at Christmas tide with many fine\nlords, the best of men, all the rich brethren of the Round Table, with\nright rich revel and careless mirth. There full many heroes tourneyed\nbetimes, jousted full gaily; then returned these gentle knights to the court\nto make carols.2 For there the feast was held full fifteen days alike with\n2\nall the meat and the mirth that men could devise. Such a merry tumult,\nglorious to hear; joyful din by day, dancing at night. All was high joy in\nhalls and chambers with lords and ladies as pleased them best. With all\nthe weal in the world they dwelt there together, the most famous\nknights save only Christ, the loveliest ladies that ever had life, and he,\nthe comeliest of kings, who holds the court. For all this fair company\nwere in their prime in the hall, the happiest troop under heaven with the\nproudest of kings. Truly it would be hard to name anywhere so brave a\nband.\n4. When New Year was fresh and but newly come, the court was\nserved double on the dais. As soon as the king with his knights was\ncome into the hall, the chanting in the chapel came to an end; loud was\nthe cry there of clerks and others. Noel was celebrated anew, shouted\nfull often; and afterwards the great ones ran about to take handsel;3\ncalled aloud for New Year’s gifts; ladies laughed full loud, though they\nhad lost; and he that won was not wroth, that may ye well trow. All this\nmirth they made till the meat time. When they had washed, worthily\nthey went to their seats, the best man ever above, as it best behoved.\nQueen Guinevere full beauteous was set in the midst, placed on the rich\ndais adorned all about. Fine silk at the sides, a canopy over her of\nprecious cloth of Toulouse and tapestries of Tars,4 that were\nembroidered and set with the best gems that money could buy. Truly no\nman could say that he ever beheld a comelier lady than she, with her\ndancing gray eyes.\n5. But Arthur would not eat till all were served. He was so merry in\nhis mirth, and somewhat childlike in his manner; his life pleased him\nwell; he loved little either to lie long or to sit long, so busied him his\nyoung blood and his wild brain. And another custom moved him also,\nthat he through chivalry had taken up; he would never eat upon such a\ndear day before he was told an uncouth tale of some adventurous thing,\nof some great marvel that he could believe, of ancient heroes, of arms, or\nof other adventures; or unless some person demanded of him a sure\nknight to join with him in jousting, to incur peril, to risk life against life,\ntrusting each in the other, leaving the victory to fortune. This was the\nking’s custom whenever he held court at each goodly feast among his\n3\nfree company in the hall. And so with undaunted face he strides stoutly\nto his seat on that New Year, making great mirth with everybody.\n6. Thus the great king stands waiting before the high table, talking of\ntrifles full courteously. The good Gawain was placed there beside\nGuinevere, and Agravain of the Hard Hand sat on the other side, both of\nthem the king’s sister’s sons and full sure knights. Bishop Baldwin at the\ntop begins the table, and Ywain, Urien’s son, ate by himself. These were\nplaced on the dais and honorably served, and after them many a good\nman at the side tables. Then the first course came in with blare of\ntrumpets, which were hung with many a bright banner. A new noise of\nkettle-drums with the noble pipes, wild and stirring melodies wakened\nthe echoes; that many a heart heaved full high at their tones. Dainties of\nprecious meats followed, foison of fresh viands, and on so many dishes\nthat it was difficult to find place before the people to set on the cloth the\nsilver that held the several courses. Each man as he himself preferred\npartook without hesitation. Every two5 had twelve dishes between them,\ngood beer and bright wine both.\n7. Now will I tell you no more of their service, for everybody must\nwell understand that there was no lack of opportunity for the people to\ntake their food. 6 Another noise full new suddenly drew nigh, for\nscarcely had the music ceased a moment, and the first course been\nproperly served in the court, than there burst in at the hall door an\nawesome being, in height one of the tallest men in the world; from the\nneck to the waist so square and so thick was he, and his loins and his\nlimbs so long and so great, that half giant I believed him to have been,\nor, at any rate, the largest of men, and withal the handsomest in spite of\nhis bulk, that ever rode; for though his back and breast were so vast, yet\nhis belly and waist were properly slim; and all his form according, full\nfairly shaped. At the hue of his noble face men wondered; he carried\nhimself in hostile fashion and was entirely green.\n8. All green was this man and his clothing; a straight coat sat tight to\nhis sides; a fair mantle above, adorned within; the lining showed, with\ncostly trimming of shining white fur; and such his hood also, that was\ncaught back from his locks and lay on his shoulders, the hem well\nstretched;7 hose of the same green, that clung to his calf; and clean spurs\nunder, of bright gold upon silk bands richly barred, and shoes8 on his\n4\nshanks as the hero rides. And all his vesture verily was clean verdure,\nboth the bars of his belt, and the other beauteous stones that were set in\nfine array about himself and his saddle, worked on silk. It would be too\ndifficult to tell the half of the trifles that were embroidered there, with\nbirds and flies, with gay gauds of green,—the good over in the middle;\nthe pendants of the poitrel, the proud crupper, the bits,—and all the\nmetal was enamelled; the stirrups that he stood on were coloured the\nsame, and his saddle bow likewise, and his fine reins 9 that glimmered\nand glinted all of green stones. The horse that he rode on was of the\nsame colour too, a green horse, great and thick, a steed full stiff to guide,\nin gay embroidered bridle, and one right dear to his master.\n9. This hero was splendidly dressed in green; and the hair of his head\nmatched that of his horse;10 fair flowing locks enfolded his shoulders; a\nbeard as big as a bush hung over his breast; and it, together with his\nsplendid hair that reached from his head, was trimmed evenly all round\nabove his elbows, so that half his arms were caught thereunder in the\nmanner of a king’s hood, 11 that covers his neck. The mane of that great\nhorse was much like it, very curly and combed, with knots full many\nfolded in with gold wire about the fair green,—always one knot of the\nhair, another of gold. The tail and the forelock were twined in the same\nway, and both bound with a band of bright green, set with full precious\nstones the whole length of the dock, and then tied up with a thong in a\ntight knot; where rang many bells full bright of burnished gold. Such a\nsteed in the world, such a hero as rides him, was never beheld in that\nhall before that time. His glances were like bright lightning, so said all\nthat saw him. It seemed as if no man could endure under his blows.\n10. He had neither helm nor hauberk, nor gorget, armour nor\nbreastplate, nor shaft nor shield to guard or to smite; but in his one hand\nhe had a holly twig, that is greenest when groves are bare, and an axe in\nhis other, a huge and prodigious one, a weapon merciless almost beyond\ndescription; the head had the vast length of an ellyard, the blade all of\ngreen steel and of beaten gold; the bit 12 brightly burnished, with a broad\nedge, as well shaped for cutting as sharp razors. The stern warrior\ngripped it by13 the steel of its stout staff, which was wound with iron to\nthe end of the wood and all engraven with green in beauteous work. A\nlace was lapped about it, that was fastened at the head, and tied up often\n5\nalong the helve, with many precious tassels attached on rich embroidered\nbuttons of the bright green. This hero turns him in and enters the hall,\nriding straight to the high dais, fearless of mischief. He greeted never a\none, but looked loftily about, and the first word that he uttered was:\n“Where is the governor of this company? Gladly I would see that hero\nand speak with him.”\nHe cast his eye on the knights and rode fiercely up and down,\nstopped and gan ponder who was there the most renowned.\n11. All gazed fixedly on the man, for everybody marvelled what it\nmight mean, that a knight and a horse could have such a colour: as green\ngrown as the grass, and greener, it seemed; shining brighter than green\nenamel on gold. All were amazed who stood there, and stalked nearer to\nhim, with all the wonder in the world what he would do; for many\nmarvels had they seen, but such never before. Therefore for phantom\nand faery the folk there deemed it; and for that reason many a noble\nwarrior was slow to answer, and all were astonished at his voice and sat\nstone still in a deep silence through the rich hall. Their voices14 sank as\nthough they had suddenly fallen asleep. I deem, however, that it was not\nall for fear, but somewhat for courtesy.

For example, Kimmel remembered that after a hotel in Las Vegas burned down when he was a boy, the city made sure buildings were made of safer materials.\nBut, after people are killed by guns, he said, all that people do is “send prayers” instead of doing something to prevent easy availability of guns.\nHe said politicians in the United States can make a difference, but they only offer “thoughts and prayers,” instead.\nBut this year, he has become a voice for those who think the U.S. government is not doing enough for its people.\nBefore speaking about gun control, he also got involved in the biggest political debate of 2017: the attempt by the Republican Party to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nThe act provided many Americans with health insurance that they did not have before. Barack Obama signed the bill into law during his presidency.\nKimmel started talking about healthcare after his son was born with a serious heart problem that required surgery.\nHe said it again on Monday.\nDan Friedell wrote this story for VOA Learning English. Caty Weaver was the editor.\nWhat do you think of Kimmel’s speech about the shooting in Las Vegas? We want to know.

Given material: Warwickshire Police held a knife surrender campaign with people being able to hand bladed weapons in at Leamington police station. More than 60 knives and bladed weapons have been handed in at Leamington Police Station as part of a week-long national awareness campaign. Five large ‘zombie’ knives, four hunting knives and a large ornate machete were among the weapons surrendered at the station during The Save a Life, Surrender Your Knife campaign which was part of the national Operation Sceptre which Warwickshire Police have been taking part in. Sgt Allison Wiggin from the South Warwick Safer Neighbourhood Team said: “We have collected 63 blades in Leamington over the course of the week-long surrender, which is extremely positive. “I would like to thank the public for handing in their unwanted knives. During the campaign, those surrendering knives were not required to give any personal details and will not face prosecution for carrying them. However, the force will carry out an investigation and seek to prosecute if they believe a knife has been used to commit a criminal offence. Throughout the campaign, local policing teams ran events raising awareness of the dangers of knife crime. They also maintained a zero-tolerance approach to people carrying knives. Officers show no leniency to anyone stopped and found to be in possession of a knife. Chief Supt David Gardner said: “Although knife crime is rare in Warwickshire, when it happens it can have a devastating effect on people’s lives and one incident of knife crime is one too many. Knife surrender bins were also located at Rugby, Stratford and Nuneaton police stations."}, {"id": 748, "actor": "Job Application & Customer Management", "prompt": "As per your request, the previous response has been omitted.
