I know that that is going to be a question that lingers on everybody’s mind. We will do our best to determine that but at this time, we have no idea.”\n\nAll classes, athletics and campus-related activities at MSU are canceled for 48 hours, campus police said, adding, “Please DO NOT come to campus tomorrow.”\n\nThe hourslong ordeal made for a terrifying experience for students as the suspect remained at large and officers in tactical gear swarmed the campus.\n\nAround 10:10 p.m., police tweeted that Berkey Hall and other several campus buildings were cleared, including Brody Hall, Snyder/Phillips Hall, Mason Hall, Abbot Hall, Landon Hall and the MSU Union.\n\n07 michigan state shooting SUSPECT 021323\nMichigan State University Police & Public Safety\nMSU student Chris Trush told CNN he saw people running out of the Union building – a congregation spot for students on campus – shortly before an emergency alert went out to students informing them of the shooting on campus.\n\nTrush said he was watching TV just after 8 p.m. in his apartment when he saw police cars and ambulances speeding down Grand River Avenue.
