If we want our companies and organizations to remain relevant, and to meet or exceed the expectations of the digital economy, IT itself must transform to deliver the efficiency, predictability and agility needed to run these increasingly complex systems. The best, fastest way to do this is to change to a cloud model.", "Transformation of the underlying processes and personnel.", "These are not necessarily sequential phases, but rather distinct areas of development that must occur to create truly modern, future-ready IT.", "The critical tenets of a modern infrastructure are that it must be trusted, that it leverage flash storage for the best possible efficiency and performance, and that it is optimized to be scale-out, software-defined, and cloud-enabled. This combination of features integrates security and data protection with high performance infrastructure components that use a common ‘building block’ approach.", "Utilizing policy-driven application and data mobility, as well as the ability to fully leverage both on- and off-premises resources and delivering maximum flexibility for both programmability and the infrastructure itself, the modern infrastructure is powerful, efficient, agile, and optimized to support cloud.", "But modernization does not mean “rip and replace.” In fact, many organizations modernize different aspects of the IT infrastructure in phases to reduce disruption and budget pressures. And while it is possible to craft a modern infrastructure using disparate, and even existing server, storage or networking elements, the quickest, most efficient way to modernization is through the use of converged infrastructure, specifically hyper-converged infrastructures like VxRail, because these offerings are ready to deploy and are inclusive of all critical modernization aspects.", "The next element expands on the foundational architectural components, enhancing manageability by reliably removing the dependency on human interaction from routine day to day activities, instead leveraging software and policy-driven automation. This phase is focused on orchestration and enabling an Application Program Interface (API)-driven environment. APIs are critical, as they allow infrastructure to be programmed rather than relying on manual control, moving us away from scripts, command line interfaces (CLIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Once APIs are fully utilized, the possibility of human error is minimized and organizations can use orchestration tools to automate the delivery of infrastructure services. These processes are now easily repeatable, more predictable and more highly available.", "To this point, we’ve been discussing technology, but the final element of IT transformation is ultimately the most critical– the refinement of new processes and the skills of IT personnel. Your team will likely need to acquire new skills to support the new model. This will enhance productivity and allow them to develop, refine and manage more applications at greater scale. Modern IT manages through policy to automate routine activities (such as provisioning) into seamless processes that provide automated, self-service capabilities, removing the need for cumbersome activities like IT tickets and siloed manual steps. This delivers a frictionless consumption experience to application owners, and ultimately accelerates business agility. Business agility allows greater innovation, as well as the ability to iterate quickly, delivering better customer experiences and ensuring competitiveness.", "The true measure of the success of these modernization is in the end results. Dell EMC recently commissioned a study with analyst firm ESG, reaching out to thousands of IT executives and managers to gain greater insight into the results of these activities in real world environments. The resulting IT Transformation Maturity Study showed that organizations that have transformed IT operations are three times more likely to be ahead of schedule on new projects and are able to free up an additional 33 percent of budget for innovation as opposed to maintenance activities. These results demonstrate just how transformed organizations, specifically digitally transformed organizations, are able to be more future focused and far more efficient than organizations that continue to leverage legacy IT infrastructure, delivery models, and processes.", "While every organization is unique, there are clearly consistent parallels.

A mite’s life only lasts a few months, but it’s the droppings they produce in the dust that people are allergic to. Dust mites can live deep within carpet flooring.

So, don’t be surprised if your allergies seem to randomly disappear!", "Another reason why hardwood is the best flooring for allergies is that it doesn’t harbor allergens or irritants. The main difference between allergens and irritants is that allergens can cause an allergic reaction and irritants will only cause slight inflammation in the airways or other mild discomforts. Common allergens include dust, pollen, pet dander, and mold, and common irritants include pesticides, tobacco smoke, and paint fumes. All of these things can easily become trapped in carpet flooring.", "The most effective way to clean carpet flooring to prevent allergies is to steam it and let’s be honest, steam cleaning can be a pain.

On the other hand, taking care of hardwood floors is easy, and will look stunning with the proper maintenance.", "Depending on the type of carpet, it’s recommended that you replace it every 5 to 15 years. Other than the type of carpet you have, there are tons of other factors that can lead to it having to be replaced sooner rather than later. Spilling things that will stain the carpet and possibly cause mold if they aren’t cleaned properly is a big one. Pets also contribute to the wear and tear of carpet in a big way when they track dirt and other things from outside through the house. Hardwood floors only need to be refinished about every 5 years, not replaced.

Becoming great requires the guidance, support, and wisdom of others who model outstanding leadership behavior. Christian leaders need individuals they can respect and imitate which can be hard to find in a world where being successful doesn't always mean commanding with character. David, the great king of Israel and major writer of the Psalms, is one of the greatest leaders in history. His writings offer us a window into this heart-the heart of a shepherd, a king, and most of all God's servant. In Maximum Integrity, Stan Toler and Jerry Brecheisen look at several of the psalms especially suited for the moods and needs of leaders and share insights born from the times when, during their own life journeys, they paused and allowed themselves to be changed by the words of King David. Using David's life as a model--including his leadership techniques and personal triumphs and failures--Toler and Brecheisen offer Christian principles and strategies for leaders to meditate on and live by.

Here at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, the Electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire, or ePAQ, is used to assess pelvic floor symptoms in women. So it is a PROM that's specific to a particular clinical area rather than being generic. Here we talk to Dr. Steve Radley about its development and application. ePAQ is an electronic questionnaire system. It's web-based. It's designed for clinical use. It allows patients to self-complete a comprehensive and detailed assessment of their symptomatology and associated health-related quality of life. It evolved from questionnaires developed as research outcome measures but now has evolved into something that's very much for clinical use, for routine clinical assessment of patients. We issue vouchers, which are sent out to patients, posted or emailed to patients, to allow them to complete the questionnaire at home using the internet. And most of our patients, about 70% of patients, will now do this at home before they come to clinic. And also, post-operatively or post-intervention patients will, again, complete the questionnaire, the majority doing so at home. And the majority of surgical cases will be able to then be seen or assessed in a virtual clinic, the virtual clinic being ePAQ combined with telephone consultation. So I was aware of the value and the power of using questionnaires-- well-validated questionnaires, well-designed questionnaires-- for monitoring outcomes in research. And what I wanted to do was translate that into clinical practice and to use it routinely for all patients coming into this unit. And what we found when we tried to do that on paper was that we generated a lot of paper, and it's a bit of a waste of time, a bit of a waste of paper. We spent a lot of time looking at the results and actually realised that thumbing through a long paper document isn't particularly useful and is not actually feasible in practice. So the other thing you find is when you've got piles of data on paper, at some point in the working week somebody's got to enter these data to a computer. And the \"eureka!\" moment, really, was when I was sitting there working through a pile of paper, and I thought, why don't we get the patients to enter the data directly into a database? The danger with data that are collected by clinicians and recorded by clinicians in case notes is that it's interpreted. And so it's often very valuable -- and, clearly, talking to doctors and doctors talking to patients is a key element of the clinical assessment process. However, if you've got an objective measure and detailed measure of a patient's symptomatology before you see them, it's recorded independently, then it's a very powerful tool to support and enable a detailed, robust and valid assessment of their symptoms, quality of life, which then can inform clinical practice. In my area of gynaecology, urogynecology, I'm dealing with patients with very sensitive, somewhat taboo conditions; urinary incontinence, prolapse, and associated sexual dysfunction. ePAQ really helps to explore those issues with patients. Quite often, things like sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, they're very difficult to talk about. Patients often won't talk to their partners about it, may not be completely open with their GPs and with gynaecologists. So enabling that process and getting a good understanding of intimate issues actually proves very helpful and actually quite often uncovers symptoms and concerns that may not have even been recorded or considered prior to the questionnaire being used. The beauty of it within our practice is that it's actually an integral part of our day-to-day clinical practice. It's not a burden to us to do this, it actually adds value. So we're actually doing something that's previously perceived as being burdensome, i.e. filling in questionnaires and collecting data. But actually, that adds value to the clinical process. So it actually makes that whole process more meaningful and valuable. But actually, having set out to improve the quality of our outcome measures in our practice, what I've actually developed is something that improves communication with my patients. And I think a lot of clinicians who use ePAQ find that actually it improves communication and therefore the clinical care they're able to provide. So the original aim of ePAQ was to improve the quality of data collection for outcomes monitoring. Actually, one of the most valuable aspects of ePAQ use from my perspective is a better understanding of my patients and their conditions and their concerns."]}, {"id": 27430, "title": "Data Handling & Parsing Techniques", "content": ["I want you to act as a Python Pandas Syntax Coding Teacher.

Lightly grease a 12-hole muffin tin (or use a silicone one). Put 140g sugar, flour and bicarb in a bowl and mix to combine. In a jug, whisk together the yogurt, eggs and vanilla. Tip the jug contents and melted butter into the dry ingredients and quickly fold with a metal spoon to combine. Divide two-thirds of the mixture between the muffin holes. Carefully add 1 tsp jam into the centre of each, then cover with the remaining mixture. Bake for 16-18 mins until risen, golden and springy to touch.

I think this is a brilliant mix of the two things that people love most, donuts and muffins. This is going to be a muffin sensation\" Review written by my 10 yr old who loves making this recipe! Lovely! Easy to make, and the sponge is light and delicious although it didn't rise as much as I'd hoped. Could that be because I used baking powder instead of bicarb?! I used blackberry jelly as I realised halfway through that was all I had, but it worked really well. No jam escape so far, either - my boyfriend is currently considering demolishing his third muffin! - but I did use paper cases. These were delicious and genuinely smelled and tasted like fair ground doughnuts. Used value strawberry jam and it stayed in the middle fine but maybe its lighter as more jellylike than expensive jam. Lovely recipe- simple to make and results in a very moist sponge with the jammy centre. I did not have bicarbonate of soda so just used a tsp of baking soda. I used Greek yoghurt diluted with water and Tiptree seedless raspberry jam. I had no jam spillages or instances of jam sinking to the bottom though I did use paper muffin cases. I used a Hotpoint convection (fan) oven and it took about 25 minutes after turning the temperature up to 180C halfway through. This is an extremely versatile recipe. The muffins tasted good the next day- at room temperature or heated for a few seconds in the microwave (I preferred them at room temp). I am going to try freezing some to see if they defrost well. I agree with other comments they DO NOT taste anything like doughnuts, but they were a great muffin mix! I made mine dairy free by using soya yoghurt and soya spread and they tasted a treat with icing sugar on top! The jam did sink to the bottom though (used strawberry as my kids don't like raspberry)! Yummy muffins that I will make again! I doubled the quantity and used an extra egg (5 in total) and they rose well. The problem was the jam, it all fell out of the bottom even though it was very thick (I used St. Dalfour). This made 14 but would definitely try the Nutella idea next time and maybe put them in cases. Also found them to be not very sweet. I really love these muffins! I agree with the comments here about these not being like doughnuts, they are definitely more of a muffin (could even pass for a cupcake/fairy cake). I made half with nutella and half with jam, took them into work and everyone loved them. I didn't have a problem with the jam sinking, maybe it depends on the type of jam, I used Tesco hedgerow conserve as that is what I happened to have in. I only got ten muffins out of the mixture but next time I make these I will probably only make 8 as even the ten I made were a bit flat. I didn't use caster sugar to roll them in I just sieved a bit of icing sugar over them, if I didn't have icing sugar in I am sure I would not need 200g of caster sugar to roll them in. if I want to make these bite size for a BBQ treat for large party and make them in mini muffin tray, how long would you recommend in oven? Delicious, but how do you stop the jam from sinking to the bottom? Would Elmlea single work instead of the natural yoghurt? We wouldn't suggest using cream as a substitute in this case - sorry.

Of the 1,000 teenagers that participated in the survey, boys on average expected to be earning $173,000 a year while girls expected to be earning $114,200 annually. The reality is, however, that only 5% of all wage-earning adults in the U.S. earn six figure salaries.", "The Schwab survey further discovered that nearly two-thirds of American teens aged 13-18 years-old believe that they were knowledgeable about money management, including budgeting, saving and investing. However, despite this typical braggadocio that accompanies teenagers, barely a third of them admitted to knowing how to budget money (41 percent), how to pay bills (34 percent), and how credit card interest and fees work (26 percent). Here is where this survey is lacking and where a crucial gap in understanding must be bridged. Despite most teens lacking this knowledge, this is not the knowledge they need to build wealth. It is the knowledge they need to perhaps assume a baseline of fiscal responsibility as young adults, but hardly the knowledge that will help them assert their wealth-building muscles. As I stated in my last blog, teenagers need to learn the below subjects to acquire the critical gap in knowledge that will convert them from fiscally responsible young adults to adults capable of building wealth.", "Many adults assume that their children will have zero interest in learning about how to build wealth, but the Schwab studies reveal otherwise. According to the Schwab survey, вЂњnearly 9 in 10 say they want to learn how to make their money grow (89 percent). Two-thirds (65 percent) believe learning about money management is вЂ�interesting,вЂ™ and 60 percent say that learning about money management is one of their top priorities.вЂќ These stats are encouraging but the accessibility to the type of education that will truly benefit young adults is still highly guarded and certainly unavailable through typical channels of traditional education.", "I strongly believe that young adults will never acquire the proper education to learn the critical knowledge they need to build wealth through traditional education or certainly not through educational programs sponsored by investment firms. Why?", "If investment firms truly provided the type of education that young adults needed to independently build wealth then it would render their own services obsolete and unnecessary. No firm would ever willfully engage in such self-defeating behavior. This would be analogous to a tobacco firm sponsoring educational programs about the deleterious effects of smoking including lung cancer. I imagine that such firm-sponsored educational programs carefully design the programs to spark an interest in young adults about investing while still leaving them dependent upon them to invest their money in the future. ItвЂ™s the perfect set-up for investment firms. Shaping young minds to give them their future earnings. However, it is most definitely NOT what will help young adults build wealth.", "So wherever you seek information for not only your children but for yourself, ensure that the program you seek does not just teach you basic fiscal responsibility skills that still leave you dependent upon someone else to manage your money, but ensure that such a program is comprehensive to teach your children how to manage their money themselves as well.

The IKEA of the 19th century. The hull is generally whittled down from a solid piece of wood, while the sails, pulleys and rigging were flat packed with hinges and thin thread threaded through small holes in the design. This meant they could slip through the neck of the bottle, secured into place on a sea of blue putty, representing the sea. Using the rigging which would be thread through different parts of the boat, you erect the ship by pulling the rigging through the guide holes.", "By the 20th century, with the creation of new, faster ships on the seas, so ships in bottles became more diverse in design.

Whoever accepts the debate agrees to this definition Arguments:1) Recycled plotlineOne of the main 'twists' central to the plot in the movie Ant Man is that the guys who Darren Cross (the villain) plans to sell the yellow jacket suit to turn out to be operatives for Hydra, an evil organization first featured in Captain America 1... While some people may have been blown away from this revelation, others who watched 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' were not blown away, since the exact same twist happened in that movie as well... In The Winter Soldier, operatives of SHIELD were found out to be loyal to Hydra, and the exact same 'twist' was used in Ant Man. Since Ant Man used plot pieces from prior Marvel movies as the main development in their own movie, this makes Ant Man overrated due to lack of a truly original plot. 2) Lack of a terrifying villainDarren Cross was the main bad guy in Ant Man. For those of you who forgot that, I don't blame you.... Darren Cross is the least remarkable villain in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, his only power being that the suit he wears allows him to grow super small and gain super strength, like Ant-Man.... Darren Cross, 'Yellow Jacket', is a far more inferior villain compared to other villains in the Marvel franchise in terms of overall power. Thor villain ============ That soldier who becomes an even bigger Hulk than HulkIron Man 1 villain ======= Obadiah Stone, who makes his own iron man suitCaptain America villain == Red Skull, a legit Nazi leaderThor Villain ============ Loki, a Nordic God who wielded the power of an infinity stoneIron Man 2 villain ======= Ivan Vanko, who makes a similar iron man suit and even hijacks iron man droidsThor 2 villain =========== The Dark Elves, who also had the power of an infinity stoneCaptain America 2 ======= The Winter Soldier + Hydra operativesGuardians villain ======== Ronan, who also had the power of an infinity stone Iron Man 3 villain ======= Aldrich Killian who using extremis becomes a super villain The point is that overall, the main villain in Ant Man is not only far inferior to the villains shown in other marvel movies, but is in fact the most inferior, in terms of terrifying qualities and strength. 3) Lack of a powerful heroThere is a huge gap in the power of villains in Ant Man and the rest of the Marvel universe, and the same can be said of the heroes as well. Ant Man can grow small as his strength grows, but no one in their right mind would believe that Ant Man could take down Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Vision, etc... The huge gap in power of the people in Ant Man to the people in the rest of the Marvel movies are enough to indicate that overall, Ant Man is overrated", "B: The movie 'Ant-Man' is overrated"]}, {"id": 27878, "title": "Programming & Software Development", "content": ["You are given a code snippet with JavaScript syntax.
