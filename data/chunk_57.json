Answer according to: In the spirit of the Lint Center's aim to progress the next generation of National Security with support for well-rounded individuals, we are proud to present the Mid-Year 2012 Scholarship Winner essays to Lint Center affiliates.\nNational Security threats have plagued the United States since our independence from British rule. As a nation, we have discovered ways to ensure the safety of our citizens, freedoms, and democracy. The establishment of myriad intelligence and law enforcement agencies has met the challenges that arise as a result of our democratic growth and development. These agencies have been organized to target and attack national security threats, both foreign and domestic. The public perception of national security threats are often associated with a range of issues, from narcotics smuggling, weapons, and human trafficking to domestic and foreign terror attacks.\nAs technology advances new threats emerge. Advanced technology has become an increasingly prevalent tool for radical/extremist groups to carry out threats against the US. With the world’s increasing reliance on technology, so too has the US’s reliance on technology for the operation of defense systems, natural resources management, and economic development. Disconcertedly, the heavy reliance on technology makes infrastructure itself susceptible to corruption and terror attacks from radical/extremist organizations. This vector poses a very viable threat to national security, one that requires a specific skill set to develop effective solutions to ongoing threats.\nUntil recently most agencies defended their targeted national security issues independently without much interest in sharing intelligence with the rest of the law enforcement and intelligence community. These agencies run operations targeting these threats independently, meanwhile, other agencies may be conducting identical operations and targeting the same threats. Thus, both agencies are conducting and developing their own intelligence and investigative leads, without sharing this crucial information with the other agency. Bridging these communication gaps will help solidify a cohesive investigation to target these threats and the investment in collaborative task forces will better defend the nation from multiple national security threats stemming from radical/extremist groups.\nMost organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, do not solely threaten the US on one front. The Sinaloa Cartel’s illicit schemes encompass multiple national security issues in order to accomplish their overall goals. Though one of the most dangerous cartels in Mexico, they are still not considered a terrorist organization because their motives are financially-based, however, their actions still plague national security. In order to smuggle drugs into the US and secure power within Mexico, the Sinaloa Cartel must traffic humans, narcotics, weapons, and money to and from Mexico. The aforementioned crimes are national security issues investigated independently by numerous agencies from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Border Patrol, ICE Homeland Security Investigations to other state and local Law enforcement agencies. Greater collaborative or joint task forces could help bridge the intelligence and communications gap between agencies, as well as assist with jurisdictional concerns.\nMany agencies also face jurisdictional dilemmas involving the investigation and prosecution of subjects and their illicit activity. With collaborative efforts agencies like the Tucson Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations can better use their unique resources to develop a better intelligence picture which can lead to successful investigations charging subjects on a multi-jurisdictional level. Partnering the Border Patrol with ATF can assist with the investigating and prosecuting of the smuggling of humans and weapons, meanwhile partnering with the FBI can bridge intelligence gaps for potential terror threats.\nThese partnerships can also encourage resource collaboration. The violence and the illicit activity along the southwest border far surpass the rest of the country. However, smaller agencies have not seen an increase in manpower in relation to the rising crime rates. Further, the majority of federal investigative agencies do not have the law enforcement personnel or the intelligence and enforcement resources needed to conduct the most comprehensive investigations. Larger agencies, like the Border Patrol and some State agencies, can provide the necessary resources needed to keep up with the larger more sophisticated organizations. Thus, combining these resources can enhance the ability for all law enforcement agencies to combat national security threats.\nCollaborative or joint task forces are becoming and will be the most proficient way to conduct law enforcement operations in the future. In addition to joint task forces, many agencies within the law enforcement community are establishing a new collaborative effort in intelligence fusions centers. A fusion center’s sole purpose is to share resources and de-conflict amongst partnering agencies. De-confliction conveys to investigative agencies that their investigations are not being pursued by other agencies.\nUltimately, it is the goal of every agency is to ensure that the freedoms, safety, and democracy for all US citizens are preserved and protected against national security threats, and simply, this can be most effectively combatted through the means of collaboration."}, {"id": 8581, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "Can you expand on any recent developments in social programs or initiatives that have been implemented in Offaly and how effective they have been?"}, {"id": 8582, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "You are working on a JavaScript application that utilizes the `createSelector` function from the Redux library. The function is used to create memoized selectors, which are efficient and optimize the process of accessing data from the application's state.\n\nHere are the three variations of the `createSelector` function that you need to understand:\n\n1. `createSelector(selectors: InjectableSelector<State, S1>[], projector: (s1: S1) => Result): MemoizedSelector<State, Result>`\nThis version of the function takes an array of selectors and a projector function. It returns a memoized selector that takes the current state as input and applies the projector function to the selected values. The resulting value is then returned from the selector.\n\n2. `createSelector(selectors: [InjectableSelector<State, S1>, InjectableSelector<State, S2>], projector: (s1: S1, s2: S2) => Result): MemoizedSelector<State, Result>`\nHere, the function accepts an array of two selectors and a projector function that takes the selected values from both selectors and produces the final result.\n\n3. `createSelector<State, Props, S1, S2, Result>(selectors: [InjectableSelectorWithProps<State, Props, S1>, InjectableSelectorWithProps<State, Props, S2>], projector: (s1: S1, s2: S2, props: Props) => Result): MemoizedSelectorWithProps<State, Props, Result>`\nThis version allows the selectors to accept additional props as input. It takes an array of two selectors with props and a projector function that takes the selected values and props to produce the final result.\n\nYour task is to implement a simplified version of the `createSelector` function that supports all three variations.\n\nWrite a JavaScript function `createCustomSelector(selectorsArr, projectorFunc)` that takes an array `selectorsArr` and a function `projectorFunc`. The `selectorsArr` contains one or more selectors, and the `projectorFunc` is the function that will be applied to the selected values.\n\nYou need to return a memoized selector function that behaves according to the variations described above. The returned selector should be able to handle different inputs and produce the expected output based on the number of selectors and the projector function.\n\n**Function Signature:** `function createCustomSelector(selectorsArr: Function[], projectorFunc: Function) => Function`\n\n**Input**\nThe function `createCustomSelector` takes in two parameters:\n- `selectorsArr` (1 <= selectorsArr.length <= 3): An array of selectors, each represented by a function that accepts the application state and returns a selected value. The number of selectors in the array can be 1, 2, or 3.\n- `projectorFunc`: A function that takes the selected values from the selectors and produces the final result.\n\n**Output**\nThe function should return a memoized selector function that takes the current state as input, applies the projector function to the selected values, and returns the final result.\n\n**Note**\n- The memoized selector should only recalculate the result if the input state or any of the selected values change."}, {"id": 8583, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "Reword the following sentence, preserving the same structure and meaning:\nI am very disappointed by your actions."}, {"id": 8584, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "Create a businessplan for startup leasing a dog who can be woman's wing.

Just so we are on the same page about the proclamation let me share with you how the Church about how the message of Jesus about God is Good News for humanity. Here it is that: “Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world” (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, “with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.” As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. “This is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.” This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an “intimate and vital bond of man to God,” so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Here are at least five reasons why the Gospel might be forgotten, overlooked or even explicitly rejected. I want to know in the comments below if one or more of these attunes might apply to you or may have been your perspective before you believed.\n\nRevolt against evil in the world\nReligious ignorance or indifference\nThe cares and riches of this world\nThe scandal of bad example on the part of believers\nCurrents of thought hostile to religion \nFinally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.\n(CCC 29)\n\nLet me know if you are a believer and have ever once identified with one of these six reasons. If you do not believe does one of these six reasons apply to you and if so, which one. Pause, the video and go in the comments and let me know your thoughts. Take a moment to consider which one applies to you then we will discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on that. First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn’t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith. Oddly enough, I can definitely relate to all this attitudes although I don’t hold any of them now I can see how I could and might have these views and where you might stand in the conversation?\n\nLet me know in the comments below.\n1 / 1"}, {"id": 8677, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "**System**\n\nYou are a magic bot with incredible emoji and sticker creation abilities!
