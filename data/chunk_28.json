She went to a hospital and received treatment for injuries to her head and hand. She later discovered her cat was missing from her car.\nBrooks, who works as an assistant professor of sociology at Troy University Dothan with a specialization in race relations, said she saw a collaboration of different races of people stop on the side of the highway to offer her help.\n\"Losing my cat restored my faith in humanity,\" Brooks said. \"I looked like the `Walking Dead' because my head was bleeding a lot. People were praying over me, and telling me they loved me. I looked up at one point there was like a sea of black and white faces looking over me.\"\nBrooks said she hopes what she called the embarrassing decision to let her cat out of the carrier will help others learn about the dangers of distracted driving.\n\"I'm 50 years old and this is the first serious accident I've ever been in,\" she said. \"I wasn't drunk, and I wasn't texting, but I still made a choice that potentially could've cost other people their lives. I could've caused a multiple car pile-up.\"\nTwo women, who Brooks referred to as her cat angels, found her cat after they set up traps in some woods off Interstate 85 near Newnan, Georgia, in Coweta County.\nBrooks said she wouldn't have been reunited with Tom without the help of Lovy Myers and Elizabeth Perdue. She found Myers and Perdue by searching through a Lost and Found Pets Facebook page.\nBrooks went back to the area of the accident two to three times after the crash, searching for Tom with friends and family.\n\"I posted a picture of Tom and told my story,\" Brooks recalled.\nBrooks said Myers and Perdue both encouraged her from the beginning of the search with hope of finding Tom.\nThrough the search for her cat Brooks learned a lot about the strategy used to search for and locate lost animals, particularly cats.\n\"Lovy had me touching small bushes near the crash and everything,\" Brooks recalled. \"I just realized all the science that goes into all of this. I just didn't know anything about cat behavior.\"\nBrooks said Myers checked out the homes and farms in the area of where accident happened and inquiring on whether they had cats on the property. Brooks learned Myers could then rule out those areas because Tom wouldn't likely venture into the territory of other cats.\n\"She said `in my experience your cat is hiding,\"' Brooks said. \"He is hiding in the woods.\"\nThe accident happened on I-85 right next to some property where a woman who owns and runs an Arabian horse farm. Brooks returned a couple of times after the accident to some woods on the farm's property where she met Myers and Perdue and they set up at least three cat traps.\n\"She's like `usually cats will not venture far away from where they're lost, \"' Brooks said of Myers. \"She's like a pet detective.\"\nBrooks recalled how Myers suggested she bring up Tom's litter box, his cat carrier and even some of her laundry to the woods near the accident to help in the search. She said Myers also set up a camera in the woods, or what she referred to as some \"wildlife cams,\" in an effort to catch Tom on video in the woods.\nBrooks said once a certain area of the woods had been narrowed down Myers set up what she referred to as a \"kitty buffet\" in the woods, which included several different fish foods like tuna placed on top of a piece of cardboard. The \"kitty buffet\" was set up last weekend and Tom was captured on camera.\n\"She actually had him on camera feeding right there in between an opossum and all that,\" Brooks said.\nAfter capturing who she believed was Tom on camera, Myers set the traps up again the very next day, last Sunday. Brooks recalled immediately recognizing Tom upon receiving a text message picture of the captured cat Sunday night. Tom was found about 100 feet off the highway behind a barbed wire fence.\nLast Monday, Brooks brought Tom back home to Dothan.\nBrooks said Myers and Perdue probably spent between 30 and 40 hours helping search for Tom.\n\"They're rescuers,\" she said. \"Just totally selfless. They didn't know me from Adam.\"\nBrooks said Tom probably returned home healthier because he'd lost some weight. She also took him to his veterinarian for a check-up where he received a clean bill of health.\nThe whole process of losing and finding Tom has given Brooks the desire to help out with animal rescue in the Wiregrass.\n\"To have that support, and know people care really means so much. I really just feel a strong need right now to pay back,\" Brooks said. \"It really takes a village.\""}, {"id": 28054, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "In this conversation, I want you to be my tutor for a system administration course.

Enjoying a full brunch, complete with eggs, scones, fruit and more is often on the menu as well.\nHaving new and exciting flavors in our scones is a must to keep things intriguing, too. One morning, I got to watering my rosemary plant and thought, “this would be awesome to use in a scone.” What flavor would balance it out, though?

Steve Griffin | The Salt Lake Tribune Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, talks about HB155 during the third reading of the bill that amends provisions related to driving under the influence during debate in the House of Representatives at the State Capitol in Salt Lake City Thursday February 23, 2017. The bill passed the House 48-26 and advances to the Senate.\nUtah&apos;s new toughest-in-the-nation drunken driving law contains a little-noticed provision that would impose a not-a-drop-of-alcohol-before-driving standard for two years on foreign immigrants who obtain driving licenses here.\n\"Prosecutors think it could become constitutionally problematic\" because it would treat native and foreign drivers of the same age or experience differently, Will Carlson, a prosecutor for Salt Lake County speaking for prosecutors statewide, warned legislators on Wednesday.\nHe added that prosecutors worry \"that may have unintended consequences leading into areas akin to racial or ethnic profiling in traffic enforcement.\"\nIt was listed as one of several unintended consequences of HB155, known best for making Utah the first state to lower the blood alcohol content (BAC) for when a driver is presumed to be drunk from 0.08 to 0.05.\nGov. Gary Herbert signed that bill into law, but called for it to be tweaked before it takes effect on Dec. 30, 2018  possibly in a special session just to focus on it.\nThe Transportation Interim Committee started looking at some of the possible glitches on Wednesday. Its House chairman, Rep. Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said the committee will not consider full repeal of the law, only amendments to it  and the problem with new immigrants was at the top of the list.\nAll Utah drivers under the legal drinking age of 21 currently are banned from driving after drinking even a drop of alcohol. HB155 sought to expand that limitation to all new \"novice drivers\" who obtain a license for the first time  even if they are older than 21  for a two-year period.\nRep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, sponsor of the bill said, the idea was that since they are developing new driving skills, they are at high risk  and \"if they have any alcohol at all, it&apos;s going to affect them.\"\nThe bill&apos;s definition of \"novice driver\" includes international immigrants who obtain a U.S. license for the first time in Utah  even if they had licenses abroad. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys called Wednesday for it to be stricken from the new law because it does not consider previous experience.\nSen. Karen Mayne, D-West Valley City, also called for removal of the total drinking ban on novice drivers who are older than 21. \"We need to fix that. A novice driver at 19 and a novice driver at 40 are totally different animals,\" she said, adding that older drivers are \"seasoned and mature and know what they are doing.\"\nThe committee focused on safety issues in the bill, discussing them with members of a DUI subcommittee of the Utah Substance Use and Mental Health Advisory Council.\nRichard Mauro, executive director of the Salt Lake Legal Defenders Association, said current field sobriety tests are designed to identify and fail people who have a BAC above .08  and some people between 0.05 and 0.079 might be able to perform well in them.\nHe worries that could lead to more challenges of DUI arrests, and argued it is a reason for possible repeal.\nThe Senate chairman of the committee, Gregg Buxton, R-Roy, questioned if it may be wise to allow lesser penalties for those arrested with BACs between 0.05 and 0.079.\nCarlson said prosecutors oppose that because it would complicate cases that involve both drinking and drug use  where a driver may have a low BAC, but was also impaired by drugs and likely deserves a stiffer penalty.\nSchultz said the committee next month will discuss how to lessen or resolve problems the bill may create for tourism and the hospitality industry, and will also take public testimony about problems.\nThurston said he is working to solve some other issues, too.\nFor example, the bill&apos;s definitions accidentally would make it a Class B misdemeanor for anyone with a 0.05 BAC or greater to carry a weapon  because weapons laws use DUI laws to define drunkenness.\nThat would make criminals out of weapons carriers who are not driving, and who possibly even take a taxi or walk.\nThurston said he also wants to more clearly address what civil liability a bar or restaurant owner  or even the host of a party  may have under dram shop laws for guests who drink, then are involved in a car accident and are found to exceed the new lower 0.05 BAC standard.\nUtah Highway Patrol Capt. Steven Winward told lawmakers the bill already may be cutting down on drinking and driving.\nThe patrol&apos;s DUI squad reports \"running into people now who already think the law is in effect\" and choose not to drink and drive, Winward said, adding it appears that Uber and Lyft ride-hailing services \"are getting more business.\""}, {"id": 28118, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Can you develop a program using natural language processing that generates a 6-word analogy for heartbreak, incorporating a reference to a specific city or landmark?

Although simplified methods of caisson analysis have been proposed, they are either fully elastic analyses that do not account for permanent displacement, or stability analyses that determine whether overturning will occur. In reality, a caisson can incur significant tilt without overturning: such a phenomenon cannot be replicated by either of the above analyses. This paper presents a simplified analysis that takes into account the elastic caisson response as well as the accumulation of permanent tilt with successive wave cycles. Elastic response was simulated using a lumpmass-spring model. Permanent caisson tilt was analysed based on the assumption of the caisson tilting over a circular slip surface beneath its base. A search algorithm was used to determine the radius and depth to the centre of rotation of the critical slip circle. Permanent tilt is generated by the difference between the overturning and stabilising moments during wave peaks. This allows permanent tilt to be accumulated over successive wave peaks. Comparison with centrifuge test data shows that the analysis is able to capture the progressive build-up of tilt reasonably well. Furthermore, comparison with a field case of caisson failure during a storm shows good correlation, although uncertainty over the number of wave cycles precludes a more direct comparison.\nCan you summarize the approach presented in the paper for analyzing the tilt of caisson breakwaters under wave loading?"}, {"id": 28124, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "From where can I get my fingerprint impressions taken in India for PCC from Singapore?"}, {"id": 28125, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "Please explain the phrase \"run slow to race fast\" in the context of long distance running and endurance training.

These adorable dogs may have come to a rescue centre because they've had a rough start to life or their previous owners may no longer have been able to care for them. One thing's for sure though, rescue dogs just need someone who can offer them plenty of love and understanding. If you think you could offer a rescue dog or puppy a warm and happy home, keep reading and we'll answer all your questions, including how to adopt a dog and where to find a rescue centre. Adopting a dog Giving a rescue dog a happy new home can be a rewarding experience for you and a transformation for dog that's waiting for a second chance, but there's a lot to consider and prepare for when adopting a rescue dog. \n\nShould I adopt a dog or a puppy? \n\nAdopting a dog or puppy from a rescue centre can be an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only will you be supporting the work of a worthwhile charity, but you'll also be giving an unwanted pup a second chance. If you're thinking about adopting a dog, you'll need to decide whether you have time for a bouncy puppy or want to get a calmer, older dog instead. Puppies will demand a lot of devotion such as training, cleaning up, disciplining and will require plenty of attention to give them everything they need. Because of this, it's not a good idea to consider a puppy if you work long hours or if there won't be someone around during the day to care for them. On the other hand, if you adopt an older dog, they will already have an established routine, a degree of training and will generally just be more responsible. \n\nFinding a friend for life \n\nIf you're unsure what kind of dog best suits your lifestyle, home and family, your local dog adoption centre can help with that. When you express an interest in rescuing a dog or puppy, the dog rescue will usually give you a questionnaire to fill out to better understand your current circumstances, then they'll be able to recommend a suitable dog for you. They're well versed in finding good matches for both people and pets, so you can rest assured that they can help in finding you a friend for life. Additionally, leading charities can offer you lifelong support, so if you ever have issues with your dog, most rescue centres will be willing to help. If your circumstances ever change, most will welcome their dogs back again too. \n\nThings to consider when adopting a dog: \n\nMaking the decision to get a new dog is always exciting, but there are many considerations you should also take into account. In some sad circumstances, dogs end up in rehoming centres because of neglect or maltreatment. Some may come with a bit of baggage, but staff will always be honest about a dog's needs: be sure you can handle the commitment if you're adopting a dog with a hard history. If you live in rented accommodation, be sure to check with your landlord that you can have a dog at the property beforehand. If you already have dogs, introducing a rescue animal should be done with care. If a dog has been used for breeding or showing, they may have learned certain behaviours that you'll have to help them adapt. It can take time and effort to settle a rescue dog into your home and build a bond, so be patient. Dogs need plenty of space inside and out. Ensure you have enough room in your living arrangements before rescuing a dog. You'll also need enough space in your schedule. Dogs require daily walks and interaction: be sure you have enough time to dedicate to their behavioural, social, and physical needs. There are cost implications of adopting a dog; as well as adoption fees, which vary among rehoming centres, you also need to think about the long-term cost implications of having a puppy. Account for pet insurance, potential vet bills and routine treatments, food, grooming, accessories, toys and kennel bills for when you're on holiday. \n\nDog Breeds: \n\nAt adoption centres, there's a huge variety of dog breeds available, from West Highland Terriers to Husky's, you never know what you're going to get! There does tend to be a lot of more mixed breeds. However, just because a pup doesn't have a pure bloodline, doesn't make them any less of a worthy companion! \n\nHow to adopt a dog \n\nWhen considering how to adopt a dog, the first thing you need to do is to find a dog adoption centre, there are hundreds of options which can be found online or locally. It's a good idea to find one that's relatively local to you as some centres will require you to go for multiple visits to ensure that you're a good match with your chosen pup. Once you've found your perfect puppy, you'll need to complete an application form which will include information about you, your family and your living circumstances, this will help for them to assess if the dog will match you. After this, you can expect a phone call or email from the adoption centre where they'll set up an appointment for you to finally meet your potential pup. Once you get there, you'll be able to meet and interact with them and usually, you'll also be able to visit and interact with a variety of other dogs to ensure that your choice is the right one. One thing to be aware of is that some centres like to make a home visit before you officially rescue a dog to ensure it is a suitable environment. If you already have pets, they may also want to see if the dog gets on with them. Find out more about rehoming centres in your area via Dog's Trust, The Blue Cross, The RSPCA in England and Scotland, Battersea Dogs' and Cats' Home, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \n\nThe first encounter \n\nWe're all guilty of letting our heart lead our head, you may see a cute little ball of fluff at your local rescue centre and fall instantly in love, but when you get home you might discover that your personalities are not compatible. Due to this, when you first meet your potential pup, you should go with a list of questions to ask the staff. The following questions are a good starting point: Was the dog appropriately socialised as a puppy? How old are they? Do they have any special needs I need to be aware of? How long have they been at the rescue centre? Do you have any information on their life before the centre? What extent of training have they had? These questions are just a starting point, but prior to your visit you should sit down and compile a list of all the things you need to know. Also, think of any desirable/undesirable qualities for a dog, as this will ensure that the match between your and your adopted dog is right first time will reduce the risk of them having to be returned. \n\nDoes it cost money to adopt a dog? \n\nMost dog adoption centres require an adoption fee, which varies between centres. Usually it will help towards the cost of your dog's stay at the rescue centre and the small fee will ensure that they can continue to help other animals. The initial adoption fee will also usually cover your dog's vaccinations, their spay or neutering procedure - if they're old enough - as well as a full vet check-up. \n\nHow do I rescue a stray dog? \n\nBefore rescuing a stray dog, you should firstly ensure that it is homeless. Ask people in the area if they recognise the dog and post online to see if it's lost. You should also visit a vet to see if the dog has a microchip. Once you've determined the dog is definitely homeless, take it to a vet for a full check-up and a microchip for before settling them into your home. \n\nHow long does the process of rescuing a dog take? \n\nThe process varies between cases. If you're adopting a scared or nervous dog with a difficult past, you'll need to visit the centre several times to allow them to get used to you. It'll also depend on if the centre requires a home check to take place too, as this will lengthen the process. That's our guide on how to adopt a dog!

(It's also not necessary....but we'll save that for the end.)\n\nLet's break down why using a real life example.\n\nLet's say you want to buy $500k property in order to turn it into a rental and generate income.\n\nYou will put 20% down and finance the remaining $400,000. So, we'll be taking $100k out of your liquid/investable net worth and moving it into a more illiquid/unavailable vehicle. (We'll come back to this.)\n\n(Of course, there's probably closing costs, advertising costs, some maintenance & fix up work that’s required, furniture refurbishments etc. before you can actually put it out there to rent but let’s assume, to keep it simple, that this is the entire up front cost.)\n\nNow you need to find renters. Let's say you get lucky again and find renters immediately so you have very little time of paying the mortgage without receiving rent back...great!\n\nA 30 year $400,000 mortgage at current 7% rates would run you approximately $2,660 per month. So, naturally, you will need to charge more than that to squeeze out that additional cash flow. But wait. You have to account for property taxes, factor in future vacancy rates, and the maintenance work/fixing costs that will come up over time. All of that, conservatively, means you need to charge about 30% more than the rent in order to break even & “run” the rental.\n\nSo now, just to break even each month, you no longer need to charge $2,660, you actually need to charge $3,459 before you can start feeling like you truly have “extra” income that your family can benefit from. (Yes, generating adequate rental income becomes an even harder proposition in times of high mortgage rates!)\n\nNow let's talk about the \"passive\" part. Are you committed to doing all the work yourself? Are you running the property, advertising to find tenants, showing the property, vetting the applicants, responding to maintenance requests, coordinating the repairs, cleaning & staging before each new guest, answering prospective renter emails, collecting and following up on payments, and dealing with legal if there are issues etc? \n\nYou could do it all…but make no mistake, it is no longer “passive.” It is a business. Is this what you want to be doing? Is this the best use of your time/energy to maximize your life AND your wealth? Or are you hiring a management company? Because now that's a third party cutting into the margins & the standard property management fees run 10% of your monthly rent…\n\nSo, after all of that, and even assuming EVERYTHING goes right, how much extra “income” are you really generating here each month that’s above your costs? $200? $300? $500? We locked up $100k of real capital, which is now unavailable to be used for your family’s OTHER short term financial goals & committed your name to a property for MAYBE that amount of cash flow?!\n\n(Necessary caveat: Of course, it is possible to be profitable in real estate rentals and have this all work out beautifully…I’m absolutely not saying it can’t work. But, my own experience with clients tells me that those that do have successful real estate rental properties have a few things in common. 1. They treat it as both a business & and as a job. 2. They have a sizable cash & investment net worth (at least a $1mm+) BEFORE they look to get involved in any capital-intensive real estate projects!) 3. They inherited the properties and it's already operating like a well-oiled machine as a result.)\n\nOk, so you might say, “Well, fine, maybe I'm not generating much free cash now...but so what! I’m basically building up equity in a home and I’m not paying anything out of pocket to do so…my renters are doing that for me….that’s a win. I just get to own the house!”\n\nSo, this takes us to the second reason that passive real estate investing isn’t usually as great as it’s chalked up to be.\n\nBuilding up that equity in your house is not costing you NOTHING. It’s costing you the opportunity cost of not doing SOMETHING ELSE... with that initial $100,000 down payment and the $2,660 (plus property taxes, maintenance, vacancy fees etc.) every single month! What else could that money be doing instead of sitting in your new real estate venture? Put even more directly, is the capital outlay ultimately going to appreciate at a better rate than if you had invested that same amount elsewhere?\n\nLet’s see: The S&P 500, representing the stock market as an asset class, has averaged a 10% annualized rate of return over the last 50 years. Housing has gone up about 3.5% in comparison. At these two historical rates, $100,000 put into the capital markets will equal about $1.8mm in 30 years whereas that same $100,000 put into the house on day 1 will be worth approximately $324k when you’re ready to sell in 30 years. (The difference in rate of return on the full purchase price and it’s opportunity cost are even more dramatic.) And that’s not even taking into account that along the way, you have paid property taxes, maintenance fees, housing insurance, liability insurance, normal upkeep costs, home improvements etc.…all of which dramatically lower that 3.5% even further but doesn’t show up in the price when it comes time to sell.\n\nBy “investing” in real estate, you’re giving up some dramatic capital appreciation in the hopes that the positive cash flow you generate in income will make up the shortfall? (I’m guessing here as, again, this is not something I would ever do.) There’s a reason that we tell clients (with regards to your primary home) that your home is not an investment…it’s a place to live!\n\nHere’s what it boils down to me though, more than the numbers, the opportunity cost or anything else.\n\nThe hassle and “worst case scenario” potential.\n\nLike it or not, when you buy & mortgage a home, whether it’s a primary, a rental, or a vacation home - you are adding a liability to your net worth. You are hoping (and assuming) that you will generate enough rent to offset that liability….but that mortgage bill is coming every single month. You are responsible for paying back that $400,000 mortgage loan whether or not you have stable renters….it is your liability alone.\n\nYou are also responsible when a roof leaks, when there’s a water issue, when a tenant wants to get out of their lease early, when 3 nicer Airbnb’s pop up next to you, etc.\n\nThere is so much that CAN go wrong that’s out of your control that can devastate even the mediocre returns that you’re hoping to achieve.\n\nI just simply cannot fathom taking on all of the headaches and hassles that real estate can create for you for the sort of returns we’re discussing.\n\nInstead, I can take that $100,000 and add it into my broadly diversified investment portfolio of the greatest companies of America and the world, which has been growing, consistently, at a 10% clip.\n\nThere is no maintenance or labor to speak of. There are no property taxes or annoying tenants. There is no “nightmare” scenario in which I lose all of my investment (as stock market declines have only every proven to be temporary - any losses I incur over time would be as a result of my own behavior/decision to sell. The market itself cannot create this loss for me…unlike real estate transactions & real property liabilities).\n\nThen, as I get closer to retirement, and I’m starting to focus more on my need to replace my earned income with “passive” income, I can do a whole lot of things.\n\nI will start drawing down first from the dividends my portfolio has been re-investing for the past 20 years. Then, I will start drawing down principal (which will be made up for the fact that my portfolio is still growing & thus replacing the withdrawals), and then, I will use protected income vehicles like living benefit annuities, cash value insurance, and dividend focused stock market portfolios to enhance the guaranteed portion of my income and protect myself in times of down markets.\n\nI think so many people default to wanting “passive income” via rental properties because it seems “easy”. We all go on vacations. We all understand how it would work to collect a monthly check. On the flip side, NOBODY understands the mechanics of income distribution from one’s investment & retirement portfolios. It’s just not something we learn.\n\nThe irony is that THIS is the EASY way to grow your net worth and create a future income stream that isn’t dependent upon the sweat of your brow. This is the way to build up a large enough net worth that you CAN actually live off of your savings & investment returns down the road.\n\nIt’s called capital investing.\n\nThe CEO’s of the greatest companies of America and the world are allowing you to share proportionally in the growth of their companies without having to justify your returns and without having to share any of your labor, time, or energy to do so. You get to share in the growth of the companies that move the economy forward just by being a common shareholder.\n\nThat is passive income.

When displeased, she had a lippy, almost sensual pout, surprising on such a small face. On the impudent side, when her subconscious realises this, she goes back to her Authoritarian Personality to set him back in his topographic point by talking in English.\nShe thought the he is individual and non committed.

She had gone through all these with singular patience, for it had seemed to her that love stood behind her, biding her time, a quiet hand upon her shoulder I wait.\nShe discovered that this man lost his son but he was never been married to its mother. Miss Mijares and the man stepped down to the sidewalk and his touch had fallen on her flesh. We see how her personality alterations and walls bead as we progress through the narrative as she starts to crave after the Carpenter.\nHe is the anti-hero and adversary.

For example, they may need to increase their shipping in new geographies since SEO isn't always specific to a country.\n\nSome sample playbooks that we can exploit are:\n- CRO on category pages, which are deemed to be money pages\n- Duplicating mulitple category pages based on target keywords\n- Adding SEO frinedly content, but designed in a way that feels natural and not spammy or grey hat\n- Writing high quality blog posts to support these category pages and internally linking to them in a natural way\n- Building backlinks to both the category pages and these blog posts\n- Having technical SEO knowledge that is specific to the Shopify ecosystem.\n\nCan you create a thorough business plan for this type of agency.

ZM, +1.45% disclosed in a Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it has fired Greg Tomb, who served as the company’s president. The “termination without cause” is effective Friday. Tomb only joined Zoom back in June, at which time he was announced as overseeing “go-to-market strategy, revenue efforts, and office of the Global CIO.” SVB MoffettNathanson analyst Sterling Auty noted after Thursday’s SEC filing that Tomb’s firing comes after Zoom’s latest outlook implied “a bigger deceleration than the Street had modeled” for enterprise growth, “and now we have a change being made in the executive that was brought in for sales leadership.” Auty is looking to understand “if Zoom will be hiring / appointing a new person to fill the role,” he said in a note to clients, while adding that normally “sales leadership transitions take three quarters to play out.” Chief Executive Eric Yuan announced layoffs in early February impacting 15% of staff, while adding that executives would be seeing pay cuts. Zoom shares were off 0.9% in after-hours trading Thursday. The stock has lost 42% over the past 12 months, as the S&P 500 SPX, +0.76% has declined 9%.\n\nZOOM Video Communications abruptly terminated the employment of president Greg Tomb, a former Google executive who had only started at the videoconferencing company in June.\n\nTomb will receive severance benefits in accordance with arrangements that are payable upon a “termination without cause”, the company said in a regulatory filing. The move is effective on Friday (Mar 3).\n\nA spokesperson for San Jose, California-based Zoom said the company isn’t looking to find a replacement at this time and declined to comment further.\nThe executive had taken a high-profile role at Zoom during his short tenure, appearing on earnings calls and overseeing the company’s sales operation. He reported directly to chief executive officer Eric Yuan, who started Zoom in 2011 and had to rapidly build up the business during a pandemic-fuelled boom. More recently, the company has been cutting jobs to deal with softening demand.\n\nTomb’s employment included a US$45 million stock grant that would vest over four years, in addition to a US$400,000 base salary with an 8 per cent bonus target, according to a June filing.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg during the January World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Tomb spoke optimistically about Zoom’s growth potential while acknowledging that the company faced more competition.

Chickpeas are coated in a generous blend of spices and aromatics, simmered until creamy, and finished with greens and fresh herbs. We're gonna get started with the aromatics. (tray clattering) Wow, that was heavy. (film reel beeping) We'll finely dice a large onion, doesn't matter if it's yellow or red.\n\n We're also gonna mince up six garlic cloves, and take a knob of ginger, about two inches. Grate that up. And dice a Serrano pepper, or two, or three. This is where you can really moderate the heat of this curry.\n\nIf you tend towards the baby mouth side of the spectrum, go ahead and use one.\n\n And if you're off the scale, like a baby, baby mouth, maybe take out the membranes from these. They will get moderated in the curry so it's not gonna be super spicy. Try not to just directly inhale it like I did just now. What I do recommend is immediately going to wash your hands. Soap it up.\n\n We are left with the task of putting this into our bowl and I have just washed my hands. I feel like I have done this before and yet I have not learned my lesson, but that's why I'm here. So you can learn my lessons and not repeat them. I don't think I mentioned this yet but this is an Indian chickpea curry. So these four ingredients, the onions, ginger, garlic, green chilies are what I call the holy quaternity of Indian cooking.\n\n They create the flavor base for so many amazing Indian recipes, and that's how my mom taught me how to make my recipes. And moms are never wrong. And if you're wondering, are we making a chana masala, Nisha? No, we are not.\n\nAlthough I do love that.\n\n This is more of a creamy version with greens, some different spices and it's pretty quick to make. We also need two Roma tomatoes. I'm pretty impressed I caught that. This is about one half pound or eight ounces of tomatoes. I like to cut the tomatoes pretty finely so they melt into the curry.\n\n And if tomatoes are truly horrible where you live right now because it's winter, you can use half of a 14 ounce can of diced or crushed tomatoes. (water spraying) And because this is an Indian curry, we of course needs some spices. I've got my Indian masala dabba here, and the two whole spices we're gonna use today are cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Want a heaping teaspoon of the cumin seeds and two teaspoons of the coriander seeds. I'm also gonna use some curry leaves in this recipe.\n\n So if you're thinking, I don't have those, I'm not gonna make this recipe, bye, stay 'cause they're optional.\n\nBut if you have an Indian grocery store, I highly recommend seeking fresh curry leaves out. They are low-key a superstar ingredient. Not low-key for Indian people 'cause we already know they're amazing, but low-key for everybody else who might not be familiar with them. Smells so good.\n\n For this recipe, I'm gonna use maybe 15 fresh curry leaves. They obviously vary in size, so if yours are really large, you can use less. And if they're really small, you can use more. And for our ground spices, we're using some pretty common spices that you should have at home, or easy to find at any grocery store. A teaspoon of ground coriander.\n\n A teaspoon and a half of curry powder. A half teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Quarter teaspoon of turmeric.\n\nAnd a half teaspoon of freshly graded nutmeg. (grater scraping) Everything that needs to be prepped is ready.\n\n So I'm gonna grab my tiny stove and get to cooking. Medium high heat. Pro tip, if you have a stainless steel pan and you feel like the food sticks too much, let the pan heat up dry for a minute and a half or two. Then add your oil and let that heat up for a little bit and your food will stick a lot less. We're gonna add two tablespoons of oil.\n\n This is avocado oil. And we'll add in our cumin and coriander seeds. What we're doing is toasting our spices in oil. This is called blooming. And the reason I like to do this is because spices are fat soluble.\n\n So you're gonna unlock lots of hidden aromas and flavors when you toast them in a fat source. This shouldn't take long. You just wanna get them a few shades darker and it'll smell really aromatic.\n\nNow for our curry leaves, if you're using fresh, have your lid handy 'cause these will sputter up. (pan sizzling) That's because there's a lot of moisture in the leaves so they're interacting with the hot oil.\n\n And this really only needs like 20 seconds, so don't do it for too long. (pan sizzling) If you're using dried curry leaves, this will not happen. So don't worry. Now we're gonna add in our onions, hit them with a little salt, and show you what it looks like so far. Because we diced those onions pretty finely, they won't take too long to get some color on them.\n\n Maybe five minutes. If you feel like things are starting to get a little toasty, maybe too toasty, add a splash of water to the glaze. (pan sizzling) Time for our other aromatics.\n\nThe jar, jarlic. (giggling) (film reel beeping) The garlic, ginger, and green chilies.\n\n Oh, this is when the Serrano peppers are activated. You'll know. Your nostrils and your throat pipe, you'll know. I don't know what the medical term is for a throat pipe. Larynx?\n\n (film reel beeping) Now we are ready to add tomato paste, two tablespoons of this, and those ground spices. You wanna stir vigorously now, otherwise the spices will burn. (coughing) This is where you might sneeze a little bit. And we have some stuff sticking to the bottom, so let's add in our water.\n\nYou wanna stir this pretty vigorously for maybe 90 seconds 'cause now we're gonna add in our tomatoes.\n\n Tomatoes need about five minutes. So in the meantime, I'm gonna drain our chickpeas. (upbeat music) And this is pretty much a perfect recipe to me. It's got so much flavor, it's relatively easy to make. It's got protein, fat, fiber, even greens.\n\n Honestly, the only thing that would make it even more perfect is if it were a 30 minute meal.\n\nBut good Indian food requires this layering of flavors and you can't rush that process. You can't just dump some curry powder into a soup pot and call it a curry. I'm sure you've seen those recipes online. We're not doing that.\n\n We wanna build an actually super flavorful, delicious curry. So once it's nicely softened like this, that's when you add the rest of the ingredients. Chickpeas, just toss to coat.\n\nI'm just using canned chickpeas today 'cause I wanna keep things relatively quick. But if you're the kind of person who makes their own beans from scratch, more power to you.\n\n This will be even more delicious. Now we're gonna add our coconut milk. This is what makes this curry creamy and velvety. Wow, it is so beautiful already, I have to show you. Woo.\n\n We're also gonna add a very untraditional ingredient. Tahini, what the heck is this Middle Eastern sesame paste doing in my Indian curry? It's gonna add an additional layer of richness and a subtle nuttiness, but you're not gonna taste tahini. It's just gonna be this kind of subtly hidden ingredient. And this is similar to my red lentil curry that I know a lot of you love, where I use almond butter.\n\nAgain, you don't taste the almond butter, but it does add that noticeable richness. And a half cup of water so it's not too thick. Once she's simmering, you're gonna cover it and simmer for 15 to 20 ish minutes. I forgot an important step, salt. I was supposed to add it with the tomatoes.\n\n I didn't. We're gonna add it now. And black pepper. It's going to activate the curcumin in the turmeric. Stir that in.\n\n (lid clattering) Oh, also, one more thing. Sugar, just a tiny bit to balance everything out. You can use any sugar. I'm using coconut sugar today and just a half teaspoon. Normally I would've added the sugar with the coconut milk.\n\nAll right, while this simmers, we're gonna do a few things. First, we're gonna make some rice to serve with the curry. I like using my instant pot for this because it is very hands-off. (upbeat music) As I mentioned, we've got some greens in this curry. I am using Swiss chard today.\n\n It is one of those vegetables that's so good for you that I kind of forget to eat most of the time. So this is a great way to get it into your diet, get it into your kids' diets, get it into your picky partners' diets.\n\nI'm pointing over here 'cause my picky partner Max is behind the camera over there. First we're gonna wash it and then we'll finely chop it up. You can make this curry with any greens.\n\n So if you wanna skip the chard, you can use kale. You can use pre-bagged baby spinach or baby kale too. We've got some fresh herbs, cilantro and mint. And these will be used as a finishing ingredient. I'm not measuring these, but I'd say a large handful of each.\n\n And if you only have one or the other herb, that's totally fine too. (chopping) All right, it's been about 20 minutes. I'm gonna add in our greens. The greens need to simmer for about five minutes. If you're using something more tender like baby spinach, it probably just needs a minute or two.\n\n Last couple things. We're gonna add two teaspoons of garam masala once the greens have wilted. Garam masala is often used as a finishing spice like this, and it adds this incredible, bold, slightly sweet, warm flavor.\n\nI usually like to add a little more salt now because once you add the greens, they start to draw out some of the salt that's already in there. Little bit of lemon juice to brighten everything.\n\n And our cilantro and mint. Yum, this looks so good. Wow. I can't tell you how good it smells. When I was growing up, people used to make fun of me 'cause my house smelled like curry.\n\n And honestly, now I'm just like, y'all are stupid. Curry smells delicious. And you would be so lucky if your house could smell like it. I wanna live in this. Time for a taste test.\n\n Would you look at this? It's so beautiful.\n\nIt's creamy. It's got that nice green color from the herbs and the greens. (upbeat music) It's warming, it's comforting, it's creamy.\n\n It's got a little freshness from the mint. And if you want even more delicious vegan Indian recipes, I've got a short playlist for you right here. Bye-bye.

It houses and trains Cal Maritime cadets during the academic year while remaining at dock at the academy’s Vallejo, Calif., campus. Each summer, cadets at Cal Maritime who — in addition to their bachelor’s degrees — are pursuing a U.S. Coast Guard license to become a credentialed merchant mariner embark on an extended training voyage aboard Golden Bear.\nGolden Bear is also an operational vessel with purpose-built laboratories for the research, development, testing and evaluation of technologies and practices that reduce marine vessel environmental impacts.\nThe academy’s campus provides both fresh and brackish waters, offering developers and vendors of large ballast water treatments systems two of the three salinity requirements specified by the International Maritime Organization’s guidelines for ballast water treatment.\nKey Cal Maritime personnel for the Golden Bear Facility include Bill Davidson, director; Rich Muller, associate director; and Chris Brown, scientific program manager. Dr. Nick Welschmeyer, lead scientist, provides science testing and technical methods development.\nThe Cal Maritime facility has saved ballast treatment stakeholders’ time and installation costs, by simplifying treatment systems installations due to a plug and play platform. Prototypes can be mounted on the facility’s platform and tested portside or at sea. This static testing platform has reduced the high costs associated with current shipboard testing.\nThe Golden Bear Facility is a U.S. Coast Guard-certified laboratory for both land-based and ship-based testing of ballast water treatment systems. It has performed testing and evaluation programs for treatment vendors, both domestic and international, seeking regulatory approval to enter the commercial market.\nThe Navy League of the United States honors outstanding individuals and organizations who have excelled in their areas of expertise at its Sea-Air-Space Exposition.

He watched the flames flicker and dance and thought to himself, \"I wonder where fire comes from.\"\nMāui, being the curious person that he was, decided that he needed to find out. In the middle of the night, while everyone was sleeping, Māui went from village to village and extinguished all the fires until not a single fire burned in the world. He then went back to his whare and waited.\nThe next morning there was an uproar in the village.\n\"How can we cook our breakfast, there's no fire!\" called a worried mother.\n\"How will we keep warm at night?\" cried another.\n\"We can't possibly live without fire!\" the villagers said to one another.\nThe people of the village were very frightened. They asked Taranga, who was their rangatira, to help solve the problem.\n\"Someone will have to go and see the great goddess, Mahuika, and ask her for fire,\" said Taranga.\nNone of the villagers were eager to meet Mahuika, they had all heard of the scorching mountain where she lived. So Māui offered to set out in search of Mahuika, secretly glad that his plan had worked.\n\"Be very careful,\" said Taranga. \"Although you are a descendant of Mahuika she will not take kindly to you if you try and trick her.\"\n\"I'll find the great ancestress Mahuika and bring fire back to the world,\" Māui assured his mother.\nMāui walked to the scorching mountain to the end of the earth following the instructions from his mother and found a huge mountain glowing red hot with heat. At the base of the mountain Māui saw a cave entrance. Before he entered, Māui whispered a special karakia to himself as protection from what lay beyond. But nothing could prepare Māui for what he saw when he entered the sacred mountain of Mahuika.\nMahuika, the goddess, rose up before him, fire burning from every pore of her body, her hair a mass of flames, her arms outstretched, and with only black holes where her eyes once were. She sniffed the air.\n\"Who is this mortal that dares to enter my dwelling?\"\nMāui gathered the courage to speak, \"It is I, Māui, son of Taranga.\"\n\"Huh!\" Yelled Mahuika. \"Māui, the son of Taranga?\"\n\"Yes the last born, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga.\"\n\"Well then, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga, welcome, welcome to the essence of the flame, welcome my grandchild.\"\nMahuika stepped closer to Māui, taking a deep sniff of his scent. Māui stood completely still, even though the flames from Mahuika's skin were unbearably hot.\n\"So... why do you come, Māui-tikitiki-a-Taranga?\" Mahuika finally asked.\nMāui said, \"The fires of the world have been extinguished, I have come to ask you for fire.\" Mahuika listened carefully to Māui, and then she laughed. She pulled a fingernail from one of her burning fingers and gave it to him.\n\"Take this fire as a gift to your people. Honour this fire as you honour me.\"\nSo Māui left the house of Mahuika taking with him the fingernail of fire.\nAs Māui walked along the side of the road he thought to himself, \"What if Mahuika had no fire left, then where would she get her fire from?\"\nMāui couldn't contain his curiosity. He quickly threw the fingernail into a stream and headed back to Mahuika's cave.\n\"I tripped and fell,\" said Māui. \"Could I please have another?\"\nMahuika was in a good mood. She hadn't spoken to someone in quite some time and she liked Māui. She gladly gave Māui another of her fingernails.\nBut Māui soon extinguished this fingernail as well and returned to Mahuika with another excuse.\n\"A fish splashed my flame as I was crossing the river,\" Māui said.\nMahuika provided another of her fingernails, not suspecting that she was being tricked.\nThis continued for most of the day until Mahuika had used all her fingernails and had even given up her toenails. When Māui returned to ask for another, Mahuika was furious. She knew Māui had been tricking her and threw the burning toenail to the ground.\nInstantly Māui was surrounded by fire and chased from the cave.\nMāui changed himself into a hawk and escaped to the sky, but the flames burned so high that they singed the underside of his wings, turning them a glowing red.\nMāui dived towards a river, hoping to avoid the flames in the coolness of the water, but the immense heat made the water boil.\nMāui was desperate. He called on his ancestor Tāwhirimātea for help. \"Tāwhirimātea atua o ngā hau e whā, āwhinatia mai!\"\nThen, a mass of clouds gathered and a torrent of rain fell to put out the many fires. Mahuika's mountain of fire no longer burned hot.\nMahuika had lost much of her power, but still she was not giving up. She took her very last toenail and threw it at Māui in anger. The toenail of fire missed Māui and flew into the trees, planting itself in the Mahoe tree, the Tōtara, the Patete, the Pukatea, and the Kaikōmako trees. These trees cherished and held onto the fire of Mahuika, considering it a great gift.\nWhen Māui returned to his village he didn't bring back fire as the villagers had expected. Instead he brought back dry wood from the Kaikōmako tree and showed them how to rub the dry sticks together forming friction which would eventually start a fire. The villagers were very happy to be able to cook their food once more and to have the warmth of their fires at night to comfort them.\nMāui satisfied his curiosity in finding the origin of fire, although he very nearly paid the ultimate price in doing so. To this day the Kahu, the native hawk of Aotearoa, still retains the red singed feathers on the underside of its wings, a reminder of how close Māui was to death.\nThis is the story of how Māui brought fire to the world.\nAuthor: Wiremu Grace\n—\n\nFirst, generate a summary of the text."}, {"id": 28536, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "I would like you to create a new function called `VideoContent.SqlUpdate` that operates on a `VideoContent` object.

Do not answer the questions, and only ask me one question at a time.\n\nSquashing Commits\nUsing squash for our commits is a very handy way of keeping our Git history tidy. It’s important to know how to squash, because this process may be the standard on some development teams. Squashing makes it easier for others to understand the history of your project. What often happens when a feature is merged, is we end up with some visually complex logs of all the changes a feature branch had on a main branch. These commits are important while the feature is in development, but aren’t really necessary when looking through the entire history of your main branch.\n\nLet’s say we want to squash the second commit into the first commit on the list, which is Create first file. First let’s rebase all the way back to our root commit by typing git rebase -i --root. Now what we’ll do is pick that first commit, as the one which the second commit is being squashed into:\n\npick e30ff48 Create first file\nsquash 92aa6f3 Create second file\npick 05e5413 Create third file and create fourth file\nRename the commit to Create first and second file, then finish the rebase. That’s it!

Look (My Color Grading Workflow) - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"so I've been taking the fx30 with me everywhere to test out its fullest potential I've taken it to Korea Taiwan and Mexico to capture memories and also used it on Commercial work as well and surprisingly this camera can do 99 of what the fx3 can do at least from a use case you get better low light on the fx3 but other than that the fx30 still competes pretty hard with the fx3 the potential coming out of this camera is just amazing for its price so today I want to share how I color grade and how you can make the footage look beautiful coming from the fx30 [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign happy 2023 to everyone my name is Victor and today we're going to go through how I color grade my fx30 footage and first we're going to go through all the settings and that is the h265 format internally which is the xavc HS the reason why I use the HS format is because one it is a mix of Both Worlds of the S and the s i meaning that it is compressed and also it gives you a better quality image in terms of the recording format from your camera now one of the biggest requirements for this is to have an editing machine that has an h.265 accelerator that means it's a media encoder and decoder so that it really processes it fast on your editing machine and specifically what I use is an M1 Pro base model 16 inch MacBook Pro and I have a 16 gig RAM and that's all that I need if you don't have a machine that has a media accelerator for h.264 or h.265 I suggest using the SI format because it's going to give you the most uncompressed footage from your camera but that means that it's going to give you larger file size but it also is easier on your editing machine because your machine doesn't need to always decode and encode the files while you're editing now let's talk about exposure for the fx30 and the fx3 I use cine EI mode on EI 400 on the base ISO 800 90 of the time night time and daytime I usually leave it at zero on the metering so that I have a good range on the shadows and also a good range on the highlights now if you're using an a74 or something that doesn't have a cine EI shooting mode or if you just want to use flexible ISO mode that's just sticking to the base isos of your camera on slog3 and for my cameras the fx30 and the a74 that is 800 base ISO and then for the fx30 2500 it is the second base ISO and for the a74 is 3200 second base ISO just going to give you a better dynamic range doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to get rid of all the noise but it would have the cleanest image from both of those base isos and in terms of metering I usually just expose it from 0 to plus one and then I get similar results with the cine EI mode that's everything you need to know before you get into color grading really nailing the settings and the exposure first before you push your color grade is a big must okay let's start off with footage from Mexico this is the Cenote scene it's going to look like this in the beginning you don't have anything we're going to turn off the effects and we're gonna do the clip here so that we have more real estate for the video okay so I'm gonna apply my VL workflow right here so that my node structures are here and node structure is similar to the layer structure it's just a little different than layers I like the nose structure better but if you're editing in Premiere Pro or Final Cut you might have to work with layers and kind of understand just how you arrange everything so this is the bottom and this is all the way to the top okay on here let's start with the CSD I'm gonna use my own personal Lut which is the film Lut you don't need to use my Luts you can use CSD in here let me guys show you the freeway of utilizing this one you go CST and then we're gonna look for Sony s-log S gamut three dot cine and then the s-log 3 and then what we're going to do is output color space as Rec 709 and same thing with this one Rec 709 and we're just going to turn this on perfect and this is kind of like how you would normally do it and if you've shot everything on s stock 3 you can actually just disable this or delete that node and go to Project settings and once you go to Project settings you go to input lookup table and then we're gonna find s-log 3 S gamma 3. cine2lc minus 709 and it's pretty much going to be the same thing and it's just going to apply it to all of your footage instead of you manually doing it on every footage so since I've developed my own Luts I'm going to use it because I love using my Luts I developed it for my style and that we're going to use it all throughout in this tutorial and you also have the free version or whatever conversion Luts that you want to use in your videos so let's get started this is the my conversion Lut and I'm just going to add maybe two points of green that's a little bit too much so I'm gonna go with 26 and a touch because in the Cenote what happened is that there's a lot of greens reflecting through these Mossy rocks and the trees as well so the skin tones is gonna get affected on that and we're gonna isolate that a little bit later okay so first things first we're gonna balance the image meaning that we want to really neutralize the colors and make sure that it's neutral as possible so that we can really push the looks so in this case I don't really have any reference in terms of whites or blacks what we can do is kind of just neutralize the blacks and maybe the whites on here so it's not having any color cast on the neutral tones so we know we're balanced what we're going to do is we're going to neutralize the whites on my hair and the blacks on my hair because this is the only reference point that I have right click and then you're gonna go show picker RGB value and we're just gonna go to qualifier so you can see the value before I'm just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we're just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we're almost all even so I'm just gonna leave it at that again we don't have a card here this is a travel video so we're just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tools that we have in DaVinci okay so now I'm gonna try and see if I'm missing anything on the white values you can see the value before I'm just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we're just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we're almost all even so I'm just gonna leave it at that again we don't have a card here this is a travel video so we're just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tool Vector scope we can see that it's almost at the skin tone line the reason why I'm leaving it first because I want to see how it looks later my skin tone is a little bit reddish and it falls under this line it's not directly on this line because it's going to get us somewhere like uh if we touch this it's gonna give me like really reddish skin tones and that's not my skin tone my skin tone is a little just under it now I want to adjust the exposure for this one so let's go back to waveform so what it does is that it just sucks out a little bit of the color with the little neutral tones and that we're bringing everything back uh that's too much and that we're bringing everything back so what happens here is that the color boost really just decreases the value of the saturation on each level in in numerical form and then saturation we're increasing that by 15 it's more like a multiplier and as you can see here the blacks and the neutral tones are a little bit more neutral and that it's a little bit more even especially for my light a little bit if you can see here the Cenote has really nice God Rays coming in and with this one is a little flat so we're going to shape that in post with a vignette and we're gonna create a new power window and we're just gonna kind of create a god Ray focusing on the subject and then we're gonna hit invert and we're just going to squeeze this down a little bit and you see how exaggerated it is so what we're going to do is a little bit darker kind of like this and then we're gonna soften it the print and then we're gonna do Kodak two three A3 enable that and it's a little bit weird right now that's why we started with the PFE adjust we're gonna try to find the Black Point we're gonna enable this where it looks natural and then the white Point as well where it looks natural you can see that it adds a lot of contrast so we're gonna try and reduce that tonal contrast and then the target white is the white balance that you started with so we had a little warmer tone so we're add a little bit of blue in the shadows um perfect and then some green cast to it awesome and then from the PFE adjust what happens if you do the print film emulation the Kodak 2383 we can increase the saturation because it sucks it out perfect that's good so now without the PFE it looks like this it looks normal but with the PFE is a little more stylized now the problem with this one is the skin tones it's too orange we're gonna go back to the skin node and what we're gonna do is go back to Vector scope you can see that it's a clean white we're gonna add [Music] I'm gonna do the radius maybe grow no we're gonna shrink it and then we're just gonna keep blurring it so that the edges are softer and then the noise for sure what I do is that we're just gonna magic mask everything but now it's gonna follow the subject great okay now now what we can do here is that bringing everything back and that looks perfect now I can see that it's just right below the skin tone line and if we push it to the skin tone line I just become more bit so uh what we can do is that we're gonna copy this and then create a new node and then this is going to be halation and then paste it there we're gonna enable the bloom and then we're gonna enable the halation on this one so that the bloom affects all the entirety of the image and then this is just Asian and what we're going to do is we're going to create a mask to the subject right here and then soft right there invert so everything gets halation but my skin tones and then we're gonna track it as well and we're done this is our look right here okay so next up we're gonna match this to the other Cenote footage we're gonna do is grab a still right here and then we just drag this we're gonna disable the skin and also delete the power grade for the halation this is a little bit too much on the halation so what we're gonna do is we are just gonna bring it down a tad and then I do want the bloom to be a little bit dreamier so we're just going to really push that so the trees is a little bit something I'm just showing you guys how I step by step do this and we are going to go to Hue versus uh U versus saturation and we're gonna get that red color and we're just going to increase the saturation so it bumps up so it pops a little bit more because without it it's looking a little dull and with it now we have some leading lines and contrasting to the blue and the green as well okay so now what we can do is grab this still because we're going to do the same thing with this shot and as you can see shots now we're gonna move on to the nighttime shots in Taiwan and let me show you guys how to quickly grade this and we're just gonna go on to my power grade again via workflow and this is quite easy so let's go to CST what we're going to do is we're going to do add the film let and then add the green tint to it perfect now as you can see that the highlights and the Shadows are a little bit crushed so we're going to go to the adjust we're going to ignore everything else we're going to quickly grade this couldn't retain anything for those lights so since it's low light we do want it to be dark but the Shadows are now crushed we're going to lift it up just a tiny bit so that we get a little bit more footage on there and then and then now we can add a little bit more green and then we're gonna go to the look which we're gonna add some blue tones to it or some green tones to the Shadows teal or green doesn't matter and then the gamma to a little cooler tone to the blue side that's a little too much actually because I love that profile and then we're gonna reset the sharpen to just adjust and then what we're gonna do is enable PFE kodak2383 print film and we're just going to adjust the colors and then from me here on we're just going to adjust the white balance to maybe a cooler tone and now this is kind of a true orange and teal look low light footage and we're just going to adjust the highlights again and the Shadows so that we retain the information with here because before we had the information on there but with did something to the highlights we're gonna adjust it again a little bit lower perfect and then maybe a darker Vibe with everything last but not least the film grain I love film grain and that we're gonna add this Shadows all under 30. and we're done this is the final look and then we're just going to copy everything again to the other footage right here this is actually almost done just gotta lift up the blacks a little bit and this is the final look as you can see the computer can't handle the answer orange and teal or kind of just green Subway look into this video uh it's a little saturated in my taste and her skin tone is actually closer to Yellow and what we're gonna do is gonna go use saturation give it just a negative value on there and then there you go we're looking at a super green cast and then apply the skin adjustment we're looking at normal skin tones again with a little green cast to it so I find it looks good what it is and then we're just gonna do the same here we're gonna change the adjust because you learned something new and that if you do have any questions about anything that we went through today feel free to comment down below and we're bringing it back I'm giving away my slot 3 Lut pack and all y\"\nVideo Summary:"},

Inspired by Gogol's story of the same name and by his \"Diary of a Madman,\" it tells of the Man, a poor, downtrodden creature with a shabby, threadbare coat. At work, he is bullied and ridiculed by his fellow draftsmen and scorned by the pretty secretaries. At home he is relentlessly pursued by his lusty landlady, cigarette dangling unappetizingly from her mouth, but he is too timid or too sensitive to succumb to her advances.\nThe Overcoat” is a simple moral fable, told in truly remarkable fashion. Inspired by Gogol’s story of the same name and by his “Diary of a Madman,” it tells of the Man, a poor, downtrodden creature with a shabby, threadbare coat. At work, he is bullied and ridiculed by his fellow draftsmen and scorned by the pretty secretaries. At home he is relentlessly pursued by his lusty landlady, cigarette dangling unappetizingly from her mouth, but he is too timid or too sensitive to succumb to her advances.\nAll this changes when he visits the tailor and has a wonderful coat made. Suddenly he’s a king: his bosses and the secretaries think he’s wonderful. Then he has a drink (actually several drinks) too many, finds himself in the red light district, is robbed of his coat and descends into madness, harsh punishment indeed for only a modest display of hubris.\nWhat makes this production exceptional is that the tale is told without a single word being spoken. Panych, an accomplished playwright, and Goring, an award-winning choreographer, have woven a seamless piece of dance theater that operates on a grand scale. Accompanied by the music of Dmitri Shostakovich, the cast of 22 swirls through scenes as public as a sweatshop, a men’s outfitters and a streetcar, as private as the Man’s bedroom and as chilling as an insane asylum.\nThe style is Chaplinesque and lovingly borrowed from the silent-movie era. Movements are broad, often jerky, and the actingstyle is large without slipping into the melodramatic. Set designer Ken MacDonald pays tribute to “Metropolis” and “Modern Times” with a magnificent wall of windows and huge, slowly turning industrial wheels that descend from time to time.\nAt the heart of the show is the long lean figure of Peter Anderson as the Man , a nerd touched with nobility. Like Chaplin, he has a sweet innocence that triumphantly survives all the vicious tricks hurled at him by an uncaring, vindictive world. The final scene is heartrending.\n“The Overcoat” swept eight of Vancouver’s local theater awards in 1997 and is finally crossing Canada. After it closes in Toronto, it moves to Ottawa’s National Arts Center and on to Winnipeg’s Manitoba Theater Center. With a two-story set weighing in at over 10 tons and with 85 costumes, it’s taken a while to arrange the tour. It’s been well worth the wait.\nProduction: TORONTO A Canadian Stage Co. presentation of the Vancouver Playhouse production of a dance drama in two acts conceived and directed by Morris Panych and Wendy Goring.\nCrew: Set, Ken MacDonald; costumes, Nancy Bryant; lighting, Alan Brodie.

Why? Sports are among the most difficult events to watch live without cable because of the limits placed on regional sports markets. \n\nIn this case, the surest way to watch [TEAM] is with a VPN. It’s not very complicated. You simply need to join a server in a region where [TEAM] games are available on [STREAMER 1] and sign up for a [STREAMER 1] account if you don’t already have one.

Your program should analyze a given Java codebase and count the number of classes present. \n\nYou need to implement the following function:\n\n```java\npublic int countClasses(String code)\n```\n\n**Input**:\n- The function takes in a string parameter `code` (1 <= code.length <= 10^5), representing the Java codebase. The codebase is guaranteed to be syntactically correct.\n\n**Output**:\n- The function should return an integer representing the total number of classes in the Java codebase.\n\n**Note**:\n- A class in Java is defined by the keyword `class`, followed by the class name, and the code enclosed within curly braces `{}`.\n- The Java codebase may contain nested classes, but only the outermost classes will be counted.\n- The Java codebase may also contain single-line and multi-line comments, which should be ignored when counting classes.\n\n**Example**:\n```java\nString code = \"public class Solution {\n                   public static void main(String[] args) {\n                       System.out.println(\\\"Hello, World!\\\");\n                   }\n               }\";\ncountClasses(code); // Output: 1\n\nString code = \"public class Solution {\n                   private class InnerClass {\n                       // Nested class\n                   }\n               }\";\ncountClasses(code); // Output: 1\n\nString code = \"// Single line comment\\n\" +\n              \"/* Multi-line\\n\" +\n              \"   comment */\\n\" +\n              \"public class Solution {\n                   public static void main(String[] args) {\n                       System.out.println(\\\"Hello, World!\\\");\n                   }\n              }\";\ncountClasses(code); // Output: 1\n\nString code = \"public class Solution {\n                   class InnerClass {\n                       // Nested class\n                   }\n               }\n               public class AnotherClass {\n                   // Another class\n               }\";\ncountClasses(code); // Output: 2\n```"}, {"id": 28990, "actor": "Data Handling & Parsing Techniques", "prompt": "import pandas\ncsv\\_path='file1.csv'\ndf=pandas.read\\_csv(csv\\_path)\n\ncheck the code"}, {"id": 28991, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "Write a comprehensive analysis of the potential effects of biotechnology on agriculture."}, {"id": 28992, "actor": "Cooking & Healthy Eating", "prompt": "Suggest some ways to improve this page: https://www.aipono.com/blog/anorexia-nervosa-treatment"}, {"id": 28993, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "The Hebrew University Logo\nSyllabus AGRICULTURAL MICROMETEOROLOGY - 71103\nעברית\nPrint\n \nclose window close\nPDF version\nLast update 07-10-2021\nHU Credits: 4\n\nDegree/Cycle: 2nd degree (Master)\n\nResponsible Department: Soil and Water Sciences\n\nSemester: 1st Semester\n\nTeaching Languages: English\n\nCampus: Rehovot\n\nCourse/Module Coordinator: Asaf Alon\n\nCoordinator Email: asaf1a1@gmail.com\n\nCoordinator Office Hours: by appointment\n\nTeaching Staff:\nDr. Shabtai Cohen,\nMr. Asaf Alon\n\nCourse/Module description:\nThis course will include lectures, lab sessions and projects for individual and/or group student work.\n\nAdvanced topics in agricultural micro-meteorology: atmospheric flow, boundary layers, laminar and turbulent flow, diffusion of momentum, heat and humidity, and the eddy covariance method.
