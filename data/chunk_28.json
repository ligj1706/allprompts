Of the 1,000 teenagers that participated in the survey, boys on average expected to be earning $173,000 a year while girls expected to be earning $114,200 annually. The reality is, however, that only 5% of all wage-earning adults in the U.S. earn six figure salaries.\nThe Schwab survey further discovered that nearly two-thirds of American teens aged 13-18 years-old believe that they were knowledgeable about money management, including budgeting, saving and investing. However, despite this typical braggadocio that accompanies teenagers, barely a third of them admitted to knowing how to budget money (41 percent), how to pay bills (34 percent), and how credit card interest and fees work (26 percent). Here is where this survey is lacking and where a crucial gap in understanding must be bridged. Despite most teens lacking this knowledge, this is not the knowledge they need to build wealth. It is the knowledge they need to perhaps assume a baseline of fiscal responsibility as young adults, but hardly the knowledge that will help them assert their wealth-building muscles. As I stated in my last blog, teenagers need to learn the below subjects to acquire the critical gap in knowledge that will convert them from fiscally responsible young adults to adults capable of building wealth.\nMany adults assume that their children will have zero interest in learning about how to build wealth, but the Schwab studies reveal otherwise. According to the Schwab survey, вЂњnearly 9 in 10 say they want to learn how to make their money grow (89 percent). Two-thirds (65 percent) believe learning about money management is вЂ�interesting,вЂ™ and 60 percent say that learning about money management is one of their top priorities.вЂќ These stats are encouraging but the accessibility to the type of education that will truly benefit young adults is still highly guarded and certainly unavailable through typical channels of traditional education.\nI strongly believe that young adults will never acquire the proper education to learn the critical knowledge they need to build wealth through traditional education or certainly not through educational programs sponsored by investment firms. Why?\nIf investment firms truly provided the type of education that young adults needed to independently build wealth then it would render their own services obsolete and unnecessary. No firm would ever willfully engage in such self-defeating behavior. This would be analogous to a tobacco firm sponsoring educational programs about the deleterious effects of smoking including lung cancer. I imagine that such firm-sponsored educational programs carefully design the programs to spark an interest in young adults about investing while still leaving them dependent upon them to invest their money in the future. ItвЂ™s the perfect set-up for investment firms. Shaping young minds to give them their future earnings. However, it is most definitely NOT what will help young adults build wealth.\nSo wherever you seek information for not only your children but for yourself, ensure that the program you seek does not just teach you basic fiscal responsibility skills that still leave you dependent upon someone else to manage your money, but ensure that such a program is comprehensive to teach your children how to manage their money themselves as well. Ensuring that your children (or perhaps even you) seek knowledge regarding wealth literacy will in the end, be 1000 times more important than seeking financial literacy.\nYoung Adults Need To Seek Wealth Literacy, Not Financial Literacy, Part II 9.8 of 10 on the basis of 4173 Review.\nHow does the author suggest that young adults can acquire the knowledge they need to build wealth, and why does he believe that traditional education and investment firms are not the best sources of this information?"}, {"id": 4203, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "Can you provide examples of green energy property features and how they impact the value of a property?"}, {"id": 4204, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "Generate a list of new features that could be added to a task management app."}, {"id": 4205, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "create me an origin story about a deity that embodies lust and self-efficacy"}, {"id": 4206, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "How can the setting and atmosphere of the story contribute to the audience's satisfaction with a tragic ending?"}, {"id": 4207, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "List the best approaches known to current science knowledge to yet unsolved Millennium Prize Problems.

The blue is a false blue, fleeting with the liminal minutes. It is soon replaced, when all the skies bow the sun in its fiery hue, and dawn comes, and you could see the city waking up.\n The birds wake up first. Their mating call is in the early morning, at four or five o’clock. I tend to leave the window open when I work, but when I need to focus, I have to put earphones after shutting the window because the birds are loud. In the sky, a V-shaped formation of birds marches across the wide blue yonder. It is past mating time now. I guess they do it early because their predators have not woken up yet.\n A bus rushes past with the few souls on the early morning commute, or perhaps they are the changing of the graveyard shift. The wind seems to howl in the cold atmosphere, and out of the corner of my eye, I could see dancing shapes in the distance.\n Far off, somewhere, a few girls are dancing in the park in the early morning. I wonder what’s their story? Frolicking in the glades, it seems a far cry from my present station, stuck on the thirteenth floor of a skyscraper.\n My name is Emily, and I’m a corporate lawyer, I guess. It hit me that this is probably what I’m going to do until I die. The pay is good, if you forget my student loans, but I’m eating food that isn’t instant noodles, so it could be worse.\n I pulled an all-nighter yesterday because the boss wanted the report finished for the presentation this afternoon. I guess I did learn something in law school.\n But I like the night. It’s quiet. Free from distractions, the constant ringing of phones and sentences of sentencing. For the night, I had the floor all to myself. I pulled so many all-nighters that Rachel joked I be a vampire. Alas, I am but an ordinary human lawyer powered by coffee.\n I looked out again of the high glass windows. The frolicking girls were gone now. I suppose I should stop procrastinating, and return to Word.\n “The term of the agreement will consist of an initial period (“The Initial Contract Period”),” I mutter to myself, “during which the Artist and the Company will cooperate to produce Master Recordings suitable for the production of one Album–”\n My stomach growls, and my eyes wander to that sandwich shop I usually frequent just before work. \n I finish the last sentence, and grab my coat. Out of the corner of my eye, I swear that I could see something fluttering, which must mean that I’m very hungry.\n Heading down the elevator, the office really is deserted. I head out of the lobby and push open the big glass doors, where I am instantly greeted with a rush of cold morning air. I duck my head down, and make my way to the sandwich shop by instinct.\n A little bell signified my presence as I opened the door.\n Amy was there, as usual, but she’s not a night owl like me. She looks like she had just woken up, with mussed hair and sleepy eyes. \n Amy went to art school, so I learned, but it’s not easy finding an art job in this economy, so she’s working here to pay her bills.\n Sometimes I wished that I went to art school, and then I look and Amy and I feel less regretful. I was surprised when she said she wished went to law school. I mean, it is still work. Art is still hard, but it doesn’t pay as well. I joking offered to switch careers with her, though neither of us have taken up the offer. As far as my legal training tells me though, that offer still stands.\n “You look awful,” she said with a smile.\n “Yeah, I just pulled another all-nighter,” I smiled.\n “Sheesh,” she said, “are you sure I don’t have to stage an intervention?”\n “It’s fine,” I said, “I operate on coffee, speaking of which.”\n “Okay, okay. The usual?”\n “Yes.”\n She ducked out for a minute out back, and I patiently hummed. After a while, she returned with two sandwiches and a coffee, the other presumably for herself, as we made our way to a table near the counter.\n “So, what’s happening?” she said, taking a bite out of her sandwich, “are they working you like slaves?”\n “No, it’s just a lot of work. I mean– every lawyer, even my boss, works really late, so that’s just the profession, and I guess I wanted to one up them by staying the latest.”\n “Sheesh,” she looked at me with wide eyes.\n “i’s ‘ine,” I said with a mouth full of bread, and then swallowing, “I did the same thing in law school too.”\n “Sleep is part of a healthy lifestyle, Emily.”\n “Says the girl who subsists entirely on frosted flakes.”\n “They’re part of a balanced breakfast Emily.”\n “But not lunch!”\n “Well what should I eat?”\n “I don’t know–maybe some actual fruits or vegetables before you get scurvy?”\n “Luxury! Not everyone can afford that, Emily.”\n I nodded, and we sat there for a moment, looking contemplative.\n Suddenly, Amy laughed, and said, “so, see anything from your glass tower?” she said.\n “Well, there’s the birds, and the squirrels, and the frolicking girls dancing in a field,” I replied.\n She looked at me and laughed.\n “No it’s true, there were these girls, for a moment, they seemed to be dancing in that little park off West Avenue and Southford.”\n “Remember PE?” she said.\n “Oh my god, don’t remind me.”\n “Must be a really sadistic teacher.”\n “Maybe they’re just doing warm-ups. Maybe they’re doing track or something.”\n “You know what? I’m glad I don’t have to do that anymore.”\n “Mrs. McGregor,”\n “Oh my god, do not, I said do not ever mention that name again.”\n “It’s the curse of McGregor. In fact, maybe she’s still putting up the girls now to her highly specialized training regimen!”\n “Poor girls” \n “Poor girls” she replied.\n I laughed. A bell tolled, and Amy gave me a nod as she went to serve the new customer.\n I made my way to a table and finished my sandwich in silence.\n The walk back to the office was uneventful, and it seems at once, the office was transformed from night to day, as the lawyers started filtering in, and I could hear the chatter of the first calls of the day.

Since rob@abc.com and samantha@abc.com were the contacts we sold the products to and it was their email domains or account ids that we used to fetch all other related contacts, they are the primary contacts. This should be indicated in the sql database contact table where their 'primary contact' column in the table have the value set to TRUE. Whereas the other contacts we found in the salesforce contacts database using these primary contact email domains or account ids would have the primary contact field set to false in the contact table of the sql database. Each contact in the contacts table should have an ID. This ID will be stored as a foreign key in the primary contacts table. Ultimately, I should be able to make queries where I join the two tables and see all the primary contacts linked to the non-primary contacts of the contacts table. The primary contacts table should have a column called data source that mentions that data source in which the primary contact was sourced from. This field is not needed in the contacts table since all non-primary contacts would have originally came from the salesforce contacts database.\n\nWrite the documentation for me extensively in detail for please, with illustrations and data models.

Answer according to: On 24 May 2010, a huge glass bottle with a ship inside it was raised to the top of the 4th plinth in Trafalgar Square in London, England. Made by Anglo-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare it is a replica of Lord Nelson’s flagship, HMS Victory that he used during the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It is also the ship he died on 21st October that year. Just like the real ship it has 80 guns and 37 sails. The sails are adorned with Indonesian batik inspired material which had been mass-produced by Dutch traders at the time and sold in West Africa. These designs are now the cornerstone of African identity and fashion.\nPutting items in bottles can be traced by to the mid 18th century. Apart from the letter in a bottle concept, bottles with items inside them from human figures to wooden puzzles have been found. It is thought that the earliest of these examples of the intricately carved ones were made in monasteries by monks who spent tireless hours working on them.\nThe emergence of putting ships inside bottles can be followed back to the mid to late 19th century. When a leap in glass bottle production came about, the glass became thinner and more transparent with less air bubbles obscuring the view. Soon they became popular both in demand and in their creation. Sailors and sea enthusiasts are popularly suggested as the makers. Tales tell of sailors out at sea whittling away to occupy their time.\nThe most common approach to erecting these ships and maneuvering them into a narrow glass necked bottle is through the ‘flatpack’ approach. The IKEA of the 19th century. The hull is generally whittled down from a solid piece of wood, while the sails, pulleys and rigging were flat packed with hinges and thin thread threaded through small holes in the design. This meant they could slip through the neck of the bottle, secured into place on a sea of blue putty, representing the sea. Using the rigging which would be thread through different parts of the boat, you erect the ship by pulling the rigging through the guide holes.\nBy the 20th century, with the creation of new, faster ships on the seas, so ships in bottles became more diverse in design. They became more complicated with addition backgrounds and models of lighthouses, dioramas of towns and landmarks.\nEven in the 21st century this craft continues to be kindled worldwide with pieces still being made from scratch. Now, we can even buy ready made Ship in a bottle kits, for all ages. So join us and create your very own ship in a bottle!\n1 litre plastic round bottle of something.\nLay our four popsicle sticks and draw a arrow headed line across one side to make the shape of the ship.\nUsing the sharp scissors, you the parent cut along these lines. Once cut, glue them all together side by side.\nTake 10 popsicle sticks and cut a quarter off of each one. Do not discard them, keep them, you will need them for the front of the ship.\nUsing your glue gun, start gluing the first layer down, overlapping the little pieces that make the front.\nWith another popsicle stick cut it in three equals this will become the back to the boat. Glue these down, overlapping and taking in turns.\nTake two more popsicle sticks and on one of them cut 2 cm off.\nDraw out your sails and cut them out. Get your kids to decorate them with maritime themes. Is your ship a pirate ship or a legal ship?!\nGlue the sails on to the popsicle sticks.\nPut dollops of glue on the bottom of the ship and press your ship sail popsicle sticks into the glue and hold until they dry.\nMeasure out your ship on the plastic bottle, now add half a centimetre to each side. Draw a rectangle around it and cut it out.\nMeasure out some blue paper to fit on this plastic cut out part and glue it down.\nBefore you glue your ship down on to the paper, make sure that the sails aren’t too tall to fit inside the bottle. If they need trimming do so.\nSlowly fit your ship into the bottle and ta da you have your very own ship in a bottle!\n1) We didn’t attach the ship part to the bottle. This way, it meant we could play with the ship in water. Go on try it on some water, it should float!\n2) If you would rather take a short cut, then skip out the popsicle stick ship. Instead why not buy a little figure of a ship and glue it to the bottom of the bottle, adding any sea and background if you wish. Ta, super easy and simple short cut for you to do.\nWant to know even more about maritime flags?\nWhat flags will you display on your ship?"}, {"id": 4303, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "List ten distinctive and extraordinary animals exclusively inhabitant of the African savanna, and furnish a brief depiction of their physical characteristics and preferred natural habitat, taking into account their adaptation and survival strategies in the ecosystem."}, {"id": 4304, "actor": "Business Marketing & Social Media Strategy", "prompt": "How can we handle a dissatisfied customer whose order is delayed beyond the expected delivery time using SQL database?
