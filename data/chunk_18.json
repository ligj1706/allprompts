Our agency is responding to an RFP for a university in California that we have a historical relationship with. Read their following RFP for a website redesign and implementation project, and tell me what you would recommend for a budget to complete the project and the key themes for success.\n\nThe RFP:\n\n Request for Proposal for Redlands.edu\nWebsite Design and Implementation\n University of Redlands 1200 East Colton Avenue Redlands, CA 92374-3720\n\nIntroduction\nThe University of Redlands (the “University” or “U of R”) is a non-profit 501(c)(3), public benefit corporation founded in 1907, and located in Southern California 65 miles east of Los Angeles and 35 miles west of Palm Springs in the San Bernardino Valley.\nThe University is an independent liberal arts and sciences university providing instruction for students of traditional college age through its on-campus residential program, the College of Arts & Sciences, and for adult learners through its School of Business & Society, School of Education, School of Continuing Studies, and the Graduate School of Theology. The University of Redlands is a private, nonprofit University that provides a welcoming environment where access and opportunity come together to equip individuals to build a bright future for themselves. The main residential campus is in the heart of Southern California, near beaches, mountains, and deserts. In addition to three regional campuses in Rancho Cucamonga, Riverside, and San Diego, Redlands also maintains a 20-acre campus in Marin, 15 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Marin campus hosts graduate courses through the Schools of Theology, Education, and Business & Society. Redlands serves more than 3500 undergraduate and graduate students, 34 percent of whom are first generation college students. Offering more than 40 undergraduate programs, including the Johnston Center for Integrative Studies where students personalize their own interdisciplinary study, Redlands has 30 graduate programs in business, education, geographic information systems, theology, public policy, and music. The Redlands Promise guarantees students earn a degree in four years and ensures affordability. Students collaborate with engaged faculty mentors who blend liberal arts and professional programs, further connecting the classroom to real-world issues.\nThe University of Redlands is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III school offering 21 men’s and women’s athletic programs that contend for conference championships in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) and vie for national opportunities in the NCAA. Also known for having of the highest study abroad participation rates among its peers, Redlands students travel the world, choosing from more than 100 international programs, including the renowned Salzburg semester, which invites students to immerse themselves in the living-learning community while actively participating in the local culture. The U.S. Department of State has designated Redlands as a top producer of Fulbright students, awarding 27 Fulbright scholarships since 2008. The School of Education offers teaching credential and graduate programs that foster reflective practice based in equity and access with degree and credential programs that train students to become well-rounded practitioners in today’s diverse educational landscape. Graduate programs are designed to meet the needs of working professionals including the Master of Arts in Teaching and Learning, and Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. The School of Business & Society equips students with skills to successfully impact business in today’s complex environment. Programs allow individuals to take their careers to the next level with a BSB, MBA, Master of Science in Business Analytics, or Master of Science in Organizational Leadership. The Presidio Center for Sustainable Solutions offers programs that focus on social and environmental sustainability in business. The University recently launched the School of Performing Arts, bringing together music,\n University of Redlands Page 2\n\ntheatre, and dance. The Conservatory of Music offers the opportunity to learn to perform, interpret, and teach music in a setting. The Master of Science in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program is an intensive, one-year program that draws international acclaim, due to the close collaboration with City of Redlands-based Esri, the world’s leader in GIS technology. Redlands places an emphasis on community impact, and its community service-learning program has received national acclaim as students annually complete over 120,000 hours of public service annually around the world. Redlands holds the Carnegie Civic Engagement classification.\nProject Goal\nAs part of the University’s new strategic plan, Forward Together, the goal of the institution is to lead California in providing personalized professional education. The goal of the website project is to highlight U of R strengths and differentiators though its online presence in one of the noisiest and most competitive marketplaces for students and families considering higher education. A new website for Redlands.edu will not only meet but exceed visitor expectations by providing a personalized experience using automated content recommendations.\nThe site will serve content dynamically for each visitor to provide a personalized experience. To facilitate this, the website’s Content Management System (CMS) will gather implicit and explicit data on visitors and then surface appropriate content. Visitor data and behavior patterns will be collected and processed by the CMS’ Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, and advanced customer data platforms. The website will be the data hub between the institution’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (such as Slate) and third-party marketing platforms. Data sharing between the platforms will allow the CMS, enrollment teams, and content managers to make data-driven decisions to improve the visitor experience.\nThis ambitious approach is new for Redlands, and possibly for higher-ed in general, but with the right partner, we feel we can make this a reality. We seek a partner that can expertly, efficiently, and expeditiously handle the front-end design of the site and the back-end implementation of the core platform code.\nOverview and Background\nCMS\nThe current website was originally launched in March of 2016 using Episerver (now Optimizely) CMS. It has gone through several major backend code updates as well as frontend design overhauls. The current on-prem CMS version is nearing end of life and Redlands will be moving to a new solution.\nCurrent CMS integrations are:\n• Azure Search\n• Azure Blob Storage\n• Azure CDN\n University of Redlands\nPage 3\n\n• Azure AD / OIDC\n• Image Resizer\n• Log4Net\n• Siteimprove\n• GETA tags\n• Custom internal Emergency Alert Service (HTTP, SignalR)\n• Other minor custom web app integrations via HTTP\nCommerce\nAn Optimizely commerce platform was launched in 2020 to facilitate transactions for the institution. Visitors use the platform to purchase a variety of hard goods, digital items, classes, and certificates.\nCurrent Commerce integrations are:\n• Custom Ellucian Colleague integrations for\no Import Course/Sections (Products) (HTTP) o Enrollment Service (HTTP)\nContent Management Structure\nRedlands has taken a decentralized approach to content editing and management. About 200 editors across the institution are responsible for creating, editing, and managing content. There is a range of technical abilities within the group. Some struggle with the current CMS editor screens. The new site will address the needs of the staff that manage the site.\nNew Site Needs\nAs pleased as we were when the current website launched, much has changed since then, and an update is needed to stay relevant. Our current challenges that will need to be addressed with the new site include, but are not limited to:\n• Mobile-first design approach\n• Accessibility standards\n• Information architecture and navigation\n• Content layout and page templates\n• Personalized content experience\n• Personalized internal site content search with facets and filtering\n• Measure, report, and respond to site performance\n• Measure, report, and respond to content performance\n• Experimentation of content and design\n• Simplified experience for web editors\n• Data integration between the website, CRM, and marketing platforms\n• Stable commerce experience with customer account management features\n University of Redlands\nPage 4\n\nPreliminary Work and Determinations for the Initiative\nThe CMS/Commerce solution has already been determined.\nRedlands will move to Optimizely’s Digital Experience Platform (DXP) cloud service. The DXP environment provides a suite of technology to create a best-in-class web experience for our visitors. Most of the features are new to Redlands and some are not commonly deployed in the higher-ed space. We feel this will give Redlands an advantage, however, we will need guidance and advice on best practices for implementing the following:\n• AI/Machine Learning powered visitor intelligence\n• Automated content recommendations based on user behavior and data\n• Content experimentation (beyond A/B testing)\n• Data sharing between CRM, website, and marketing platforms to inform content\nrecommendations and suggested next-step actions for visitors\n• Multilingual site and content management approach\nLogo, colors, and typography have been selected.\nRedlands will NOT rebrand during this initiative. A style guide is available for reference.\nTwo website audits have been completed.\nThe results of a user journey audit and content audit will be shared.\nCurrent Site Information\nCMS\n• Version: 11.20.7+\n• Page count: 6K\n• Annual pageviews: 5MM\n• Annual unique visitors: 1.7MM\n• Number of page templates: 31\n• Number of content blocks: 168\nCommerce\n• Version: 13.31.0+\n• Number of products\no 235 Products\no 3 Product Types • Annual transactions\no 250+\nDeliverables and Requirements\nThe services, deliverables, and requirements that U of R is seeking for the initiative will include:\n• Site redesign using current Redlands brand and style within the Optimizely DXP University of Redlands Page 5\n \nplatform\n• Implementation of core platform code, pages, blocks, products, variants, and\ntemplates for CMS and Commerce\no The number of page templates and content blocks will be determined by the\nnew site design and partner recommendations.\n• Implementation of Optimizely Data Platform\no Ingestion of third-party data sources (CRM and marketing platforms)\no Exposure of CMS data to third-party data platforms (CRM and marketing\nplatforms)\no Set up initial mechanisms for content automation\n• Set up processes for modifying UI/CSS/JS/CMS/Templates/Deployment\n• Set up processes for pre-prod, implementation, production\n• In-house tools include: PC/MAC/Dev environment/Code repository\n• Process for creating/moving/migrating content from old site to new site\n• Anything else recommended or deemed necessary by both UR and partner to achieve\nsuccess\n• Transition the site to Redlands for in-house management and development\nTimeline\nThe launch date goal is June 2024.\nSubmission requirements\nResponses should include\n• Background on the firm\n• Team members assigned to our account\n• Demonstrated understanding of and/or experience in similar work\n• Two references\n• Overview of process\n• Timeline\n• Breakdown of cost estimates\nAdditional information\nSpecial consideration will be given to agencies who have experience with:\n• Optimizely DXP implementations\n• Optimizely Data Platform (formerly Zaius Customer Data Platform)\n• Integrating third-party data with Optimizely DXP\n• Higher education landscape in California\n• Slate CRM\n University of Redlands\nPage 6\n\nSelection Schedule\nIssue RFP: Notification of Intent: Deadline for Questions: Proposals Due: Finalist Presentations: Award Bid - Selection:\nQuestions\n03/03/2023 03/10/2023 03/17/2023 03/31/2023\nWeek of April 17, 2023 Week of April 24, 2023\nFor questions about the project and technical requirements, please email Jaye\\_Howard@redlands.edu by 03/17/2023.

That’s just a taste of why the NYPD is entirely right to keep up this most basic law enforcement.\nFor starters, farebeating cost the MTA $225 million in lost revenues last year. That’s robbery from every straphanger who needs the subways and buses to function.\nAnd the rampant practice adds to disorder on the subways: Get away with crossing one line, you’re more likely to cross others.\nSo it’s an excellent sign that police brass last week dispatched dozens of desk-bound cops to patrol 15 Manhattan subway stations south of 59th Street. The Transit High Visibility Detail is “to ensure maximum coverage during the morning rush hours,” declares a memo from NYPD Chief of Staff Raymond Spinella.\nSome cops gripe about it, since the Manhattan district attorney has decided not to prosecute most farebeaters: “It’s a waste of time to arrest them, because Cy Vance isn’t going to prosecute,” a police source told The Post.\nNot a complete waste, as the arrest of that accused murderer shows. And it teaches at least two important lessons: Don’t steal — and farebeating is indeed theft.\nThat’s something too many younger New Yorkers don’t seem to realize, judging from their comments to Post reporters.\n“Everyone does it regardless of whether they can pay,” an 18-year-old told The Post after officers stopped him from entering via an open gate.\nNYC Transit President Andy Byford just got slammed for calling for more cops on city buses to fight farebeating, but he’s absolutely right — and not just because the MTA needs the money.\nA city that refuses to teach respect for the law, and for your fellow citizens, eventually won’t see much of either."}, {"id": 2758, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Can you put your analytical skills to the test and unravel the intricate code to unveil the identities of the most exclusive books that are present in just one copy throughout the world?

The `Bot` class is defined in the `oanda_bot.oanda_bot` module.\n\nThe code snippet above shows an import statement that is used to import the `Bot` class from the `oanda_bot.oanda_bot` module. Additionally, the snippet includes a placeholder `<gh_stars>10-100`. It indicates that the `Bot` class has a property called `gh_stars`, which represents the popularity of the trading bot on GitHub, with a value range between 10 and 100.\n\nYour task is to implement the `Bot` class and ensure that it has the following behavior:\n\n1. The `Bot` class should have a constructor that takes two parameters:\n   - `name` (string) - The name of the trading bot.\n   - `gh_stars` (integer) - The popularity of the trading bot on GitHub. This property should default to 10 if no value is provided.\n\n2. The `Bot` class should have a method called `get_popularity` that returns the popularity of the trading bot on GitHub.\n\n3. The `Bot` class should have a method called `set_popularity` that takes one parameter:\n   - `gh_stars` (integer) - The new popularity value for the trading bot on GitHub.\n\n   The `set_popularity` method should validate that the provided `gh_stars` value is within the range of 10 to 100 (inclusive) and update the `gh_stars` property accordingly. If the provided value is outside this range, the `gh_stars` property should remain unchanged.\n\n4. The `Bot` class should have a method called `increase_popularity` that takes no parameters and increases the popularity of the trading bot on GitHub by 10.\n\n5. The `Bot` class should have a method called `decrease_popularity` that takes no parameters and decreases the popularity of the trading bot on GitHub by 10. The popularity value should not go below 10.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- The `name` parameter of the `Bot` class constructor will be a non-empty string of alphanumeric characters and spaces (e.g., \"My Trading Bot\").\n- The `gh_stars` parameter of the `Bot` class constructor and the `set_popularity` method will be an integer within the range of 0 to 200 (inclusive).

Someone needs to receive your beautiful newsletters created on MailerLite so you need to have a great way to handle that data. There are a few different ways how it can be achieved:\n\nAdd subscriber form in our web app\nPublic HTTP API endpoint\nCustom and unique web form or landing page\nOther services which are integrated with MailerLite using our API\nAll the ways mentioned above are based on using a single service dedicated to the management of subscribers.\n\nTask: API Integration\nYour main task is to create a simple PHP application for managing the subscribers of a MailerLite account via the MailerLite API.\n\nYou can find more information about the MailerLite API at https://developers.mailerlite.com\n\nFeatures\nYour PHP application should have the following features:\n\nValidating and saving an API key:\n\nValidate an account's API key against the MailerLite API\nSave the valid key in the database.\nNext time the user opens the page, load the key from the database\nShowing the subscribers of an account:\n\nUse DataTables (https://datatables.net/) to display all the subscribers of the account. The email, name, country, subscribe date and subscribe time of each subscriber should be displayed on the table (5 fields).\nAn account may have millions of subscribers so it is not efficient to load and show all of them at once. For that reason, you should implement pagination and only load a few subscribers for each page. To implement this feature, please use the server side data source of the DataTables library.\nIt should be possible to use the search field to search for subscribers by email and to change the number of subscribers displayed per page.\nDo not do any direct calls to the MailerLite API from the frontend. Instead, proxy all requests through the backend of your application.\nThe subscribe date should be in the day/month/year format while the subscribe time should be in the 24-hour format with leading zeroes.\n\nCreating subscribers:\n\nCreate a page with a form that asks the user to type the email, name and country of a subscriber.\nBy pressing submit, your backend creates a new subscriber using the MailerLite API.\nAPI errors are handled gracefully by your application (e.g. subscriber already exists, invalid email, etc.) and an error is shown to the user\nOn success, a message is shown to the user.\nDeleting a subscriber:\n\nA button should exist next to each subscriber in the DataTable that deletes the subscriber via a MailerLite API call.\nLike before, do not call the MailerLite API from the frontend but proxy the request through your backend.\nNo need to show a popup to confirm the delete, just delete the subscriber.\nOptional bonus: handle everything (delete and table refresh) without a page redirect.\nEditing a subscriber:\n\nClicking on a subscriber email in the DataTable opens the a form that allows the editing of the name and country subscriber fields only.\nOn save, the subscriber information is saved to MailerLite via an API call.\nGeneral Requirements\nLaravel framework\nHTTP JSON API\nValidating requests\nInstructions how to run a project on local environment running PHP 7.4, MySQL 5.x and the latest Chrome browser\nPSR-2 compliant source code\nWrite tests for the backend of your app\nTask II: Finish Line\nCreate a public repository on GitHub for your application source code, push it and send us the link\n\nDo not develop:\nUser authentication\nCSRF\nDatabase migrations (just provide the .sql file)"}, {"id": 2849, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Every banner is made to order and carefully, lovingly hand-lettered.\nBanners range in 3 general sizes, but feel free to request specific dimensions!\nYou will be e-mailed a proof of the banner within 48 business hours.
