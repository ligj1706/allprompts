It will explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system, what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the system will react to external stimuli. This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system and will be proposed to the Regional Historical Society for its approval.\nScope of Project\nThis software system will be a Web Publishing System for a local editor of a regional historical society. This system will be designed to maximize the editor’s productivity by providing tools to assist in automating the article review and publishing process, which would otherwise have to be performed manually. By maximizing the editor’s work efficiency and production the system will meet the editor’s needs while remaining easy to understand and use.\nMore specifically, this system is designed to allow an editor to manage and communicate with a group of reviewers and authors to publish articles to a public website. The software will facilitate communication between authors, reviewers, and the editor via E-Mail. Preformatted reply forms are used in every stage of the articles’ progress through the system to provide a uniform review process; the location of these forms is configurable via the application’s maintenance options. The system also contains a relational database containing a list of Authors, Reviewers, and Articles.\nThe Web Publishing System has four active actors and one cooperating system. \nThe Author, Reader, or Reviewer accesses the Online Journal through the Internet. Any Author or Reviewer communication with the system is through email. The Editor accesses the entire system directly. There is a link to the (existing) Historical Society.\n<< The division of the Web Publishing System into two component parts, the Online Journal and the Article Manager, is an example of using domain classes to make an explanation clearer. >>The only link to an external system is the link to the Historical Society (HS) Database to verify the membership of a Reviewer. The Editor believes that a society member is much more likely to be an effective reviewer and has imposed a membership requirement for a Reviewer. The HS Database fields of interest to the Web Publishing Systems are member’s name, membership (ID) number, and email address (an optional field for the HS Database).\nThe Assign Reviewer use case sends the Reviewer ID to the HS Database and a Boolean is returned denoting membership status. The Update Reviewer use case requests a list of member names, membership numbers and (optional) email addresses when adding a new Reviewer. It returns a Boolean for membership status when updating a Reviewer.\n\nThis project is to be created by the SoftwareDevelopmentInc where I am the project manager of this project.

But the company is focusing on the long term, and the long-term question for investors is whether or not Apple can continue this tremendous growth. Referring to last year, Cook highlighted that Apple has grown by about $48 billion, booking $24 billion from China alone, the biggest sales revenue of all US technology companies they are “aware of”.\nWhen asked whether he still considers the Einhorn lawsuit silly, he said he does, despite the judge’s ruling. A proposal that would have required Apple to get shareholder approval before issuing a new class of preferred shares was scrapped before the meeting.\nAs anticipated, Tim Cook was vague when talking about future plans.
