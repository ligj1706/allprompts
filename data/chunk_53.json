I would like you're help building a slack app that sends job failure and success notifications. I found a lot of documentation on the topic, can I provide you this information over a series of messages? Here's the first instructions, below. When you are ready for more, respond OK.\n\nCreating Slack Messages from Platform\nAvatar Tori Becker\nUpdated 1 year ago\nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \nPart 1: Creating the Slack Credential \nClick on the workspace dropdown in the top left of Slack, and select “Customize [Workspace name]”:\n\nmceclip0.png\n\n \n\nThis will take you to the web browser of Slack. Click “Menu” in the top left corner, followed by “Configure apps”: \n\nmceclip1.png\n \n\nThat will take you to the Slack App Directory. Then click “Build” in the main toolbar:\n\nmceclip2.png\n\n \n\nClick “Create New App”. It's common for the app to have to be approved by the Slack administrator at your organization:\n\nmceclip3.png\n\n\nYou’ll now be prompted to follow a series of set up steps. You should follow the Slack documentation to get to the level of access you’ll need for your given use case. Here are some help docs that helped us as we made this: \n\nhttps://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#calling\nhttps://api.slack.com/messaging/composing/layouts#attachments\n \n \n\nIf you’re planning to use the Platform to Slack script template in part 3, you’ll need the Slack app to at least have the following features and functionalities added (screenshot below), as well as the specific OAuth scopes (Slack’s term for permissions), found under “Permissions”:\n\nmceclip4.png\n\n \n\nmceclip5.png\n\n \n\nNote: the OAuth Scopes in Slack have great descriptions, as shown above. Use those to determine if you need to add additional scopes for your use case. You can also use incoming-webhooks to create messages from Google Forms, etc. \n\n\nOnce the scopes have been added, it’s time to request your app be installed by your administrator. This will allow you to get the OAuth token you’ll need to make a Platform credential. You can do this in the “OAuth & Permissions” page of your app, click “Request to Install”: \n\nmceclip6.png\n\nOnce your admin approves of the app, Slack will alert you by sending a Slackbot message like this: \n\nmceclip7.png\n\nNow, you should be able to see an OAuth token that’s been generated for your app. This is blocked out in the below screenshot for security purposes but you should see a long password value in this field that you can copy: \n\nmceclip8.png\n\nLastly, make sure to add the app to the channels you want it to write to in Slack. You can do so by opening the Slack channel details, clicking “Integrations”, and clicking “Add apps”: \n\nmceclip10.png\n\n \n\n \n\nPart 2: Creating the Platform Credential \nNow, it’s time to store your Slack OAuth in Platform. You can follow these instructions for generic credential creation. \n\n \n\n“Name” will be what’s displayed in Platform, so pick something intuitive. \n“Type” should be “Custom”. \n“Username” can be anything, but cannot be blank. \n“Password” will be the OAuth Token displayed by Slack in the screenshot above. \n“Remote host” should be left blank. \nmceclip11.png\n\nPart 3: Running the Platform Job \n \n\nCreate a new script from this template. If you are not shared on template 178902, please contact support@civisanalytics.com . \n\n“Credential” should be the Platform credential created in step 2. \n“Channel” should be the Slack channel you wish to write to. \n“Text” should be the text you wish to post. For emojis, links, or mentions, please check this Slack documentation for the proper syntax i.e. :heavy\\_check\\_mark: for ✔️or for @here \nRun your job and expect the text to be posted in the designated channel like so:mceclip0.png\n\nPro tip: include this job at the end of a workflow."}, {"id": 8033, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet that involves a conditional statement and variable assignments.

The method should modify the `buckets` list in-place by appending the given `element` to the specified bucket.\n\n**Constraints**\n- The `index` will be a non-negative integer.\n- The length of the `buckets` list initially will be less than or equal to `index`.\n- The `element` can be of any type.\n\n**Example**\n\n```python\nbucket_list = BucketList()\n\nbucket_list.append_to_bucket(0, 10)\nprint(bucket_list.buckets)  # Output: [[10]]\n\nbucket_list.append_to_bucket(1, \"a\")\nbucket_list.append_to_bucket(1, \"b\")\nbucket_list.append_to_bucket(1, \"c\")\n\nprint(bucket_list.buckets)  # Output: [[10], [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]]\n\nbucket_list.append_to_bucket(2, [1, 2, 3])\nprint(bucket_list.buckets)  # Output: [[10], [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], [[1, 2, 3]]]\n```"}, {"id": 8068, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "I need help with my course called \"Computer Simulation and Modelling\".
