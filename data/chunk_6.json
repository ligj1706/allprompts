You get scared or you think it is a dream, or maybe you’ll think it is a prank, but this is neither a dream nor a prank, this is reality.\nA reality which we faced in 1947, that got repeated in 1975, then in 1984, 1993, 2002, 2014 and keeps repeating itself now on a daily basis. Yes the reality of a murder.\nThis hard hitting poem speaks about the same reality which have been ignoring for years now.\nThis poem will make you question your affinity for ethnocentrism, because all that ethnocentrism has gifted us over the years is bloodshed.\nIt is high time that we start promoting our PLEA FOR PEACE else it will be too late for us to regret.\nSo you people have come again today?\nWhere are you planning to burn me today?\nAnd how will you make me believe that this won’t happen again?\nThat you won’t defame me again?\nThat you won’t associate me with a particular religion again?\nI often meet wondering souls who still haven’t slept in those graveyards.\nSouls of people you burnt during riots.\nSome of you could only recognise my saffron.\nSome spoke about the Green in me.\nToday they have murdered another Ram Prasad Bismil.\nAnd you became the killers of another Ashfaqullah Khan.\nAfter listening to this tale, The entire world is in the state of shock.\nBut you forgot to notice the colour of peace in me.Looks like you still haven’t recognised me.\nIt happens, because people usually forget the dead.\nI am the Martydom of the Martyrs.\nI am the one you decorated me with joy and excitement.\nI am the indication of your freedom.\nI still live in the hearts of many.\nYes! I have been painted in the colours of peace, courage and freedom.\nI was hoisted at the Kargil, to signify your victories.\nBut look at the condition your shamelessness has put me into..\nI myself am a cloth and I am still naked.\nDo you recognise me now?\nI am the tricolour, I am the tricolour, I am the tricolour, Your National Flag.\nYou have to hear this heart wrenching yet powerful song on the practice of manual scavenging in India!

The monoplane bomber reached this speed even though it had a five-person crew (in open cockpits) and carried a 2,400-pound (1089 kilogram) bomb load.\nBoeing built the YB-9 prototype bombers at company expense to show their design potential to the military. The B-9 is recognized as a revolution in bomber design, introducing new structures and aerodynamic concepts including the first use of a servo tab on an American airplane. Unfortunately for Boeing, this high-speed aircraft inspired the Glenn L. Martin Company to launch a new generation of bombers, resulting in the B-10, which quickly surpassed the B-9.

Here is the abstract:\n\n\"\"\"\nTranscriptome engineering technologies that can effectively and precisely perturb mammalian RNAs are needed to accelerate biological discovery and RNA therapeutics. However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs. Finally, our Cas13d guide efficiency model successfully generalized to DjCas13d, highlighting the utility of a comprehensive approach combining machine learning with ortholog discovery to advance RNA targeting in human cells.\n\"\"\"\n\nI don't really understand what is Cas13d, what is RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNA, what are Cas13d orthologs.

Bands ] | 🏆 Best Beginners Guide By 💪 James Grage, Undersun Fitness - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"what's going on welcome to rbt resistance band training i'm james grage and today we're going to talk about how to get started with resistance band training the first thing that i want to jump into and this is one of the more common questions that i get is the difference between a flat or loop style power band which is what a lot of people call this versus a tube style resistance band where you see then it's got all these attachments here on the end and handles now when i first started working out with resistance bands about 11 years ago this is how i started with these tube style bands and then through the years i end up migrating over to this style which is this power style band and i'll explain to you why and a lot of this has to do with what's called linear variable resistance so what linear variable resistance means is the more that you stretch a band the harder it gets and that's one of the nice things about bands is for example with these under sun fitness bands if i were to hang this one back up you can see that i've got five different levels of resistance those come in a little drawstring bag and so one of the most common questions is well does that mean i only have five levels of resistance in other words if you were to equate that to dumbbells would it be the same as only having five dumbbells and the answer is no and that's because of linear variable resistance so let's jump into that let's talk about what that is and how do you get different levels of resistance using this tube style band as an example there's a few ways that you can increase the resistance by stretching the band more now with these i can stretch the band more by widening my stance so if i stand really narrow you see i've got more band here so it's not stretched as much in my starting position so it's going to be easier here at the beginning or if i want to pre-stretch the band i can widen my stance and now i'm stretching the band creating more resistance so that is the basics of linear variable resistance now there's a couple different ways that you can do it but there's a limitation with these and that is because of the handles themselves so it's nice and convenient to have these handles to grab onto but it also eliminates one of the ways that you can create different levels of resistance if we go over here to the loop style band so if i stand on this anchor it under my feet the exact same way i can grab this at the top like this or if i want more resistance and if i want to adjust it in incremental levels i can just grab further down on the band and create more resistance go even further down pre-stretch it more and create even more resistance and i can keep doing that so i've got almost i'm not going to say unlimited levels of resistance but i've got so many different variations and that's why when people ask well what is the equivalent resistance level in one of these bands compared to free weights and the first thing i say is depends on how much you stretch it so for example with the extra light band this has a range of about 5 to 15 pounds again the difference between 5 pounds versus 15 is how much you stretch it when we come over to the light band we've got 20 to 35 pounds of resistance coming to a medium band 30 to 50 pounds of resistance the heavy band roughly 40 to 80 pounds of resistance and then we come into the monster here this is the extra heavy and we've got anywhere from 50 to 120 pounds of resistance so let's talk about all those ways that we can adjust the resistance level so you saw two ways already one is our foot position how wide is our stance and how much are we stretching the band the second one is adjusting our hand position which is why i like these flat style bands because i have more flexibility than i do with a tube style but the other way is adjusting the distance from our anchor point so that takes us into the next topic which is anchored exercises versus unanchored exercises so if anyone's following the ta2 program which stands for train anytime train anywhere which is the program that i developed using resistance bands in the first month of the program we do unanchored exercises meaning that we're anchoring the band with our own body the reason i do that is it's giving you a foundation of exercises that you can do anywhere you don't need a doorway you don't need to anchor it to a pull-up bar all you need is your own body so you could do this on the beach you could do it on top of a mountain you could do it on the moon if you wanted to if you can get to the moon so let's talk about anchored exercises so those are unanchored meaning we're using our body now anchored exercises meaning we're anchoring it to something so there's a couple ways to do that the first reach over here this is a door anchor and this is a really awesome little tool and if you look at this on one side it's got a round piece of foam with a hard plastic core in it that the strap runs through and on the other side is a loop now we can use any door i've got a fake door here yes i have a fake door in the studio i'm going to come over here and show you how this works so open the door and you put the soft foam side through the door keep the strap nice and flat and you're going to shut the door now i do recommend doing it the opposite way that i just did it meaning it's better to anchor on the side of the door that closes and that way when you're pulling on this there's no chance of the door coming open you're actually pulling the door shut which is what you want to do so don't really have a choice here so that is step one if you do have to anchor it on the side of the door that opens make sure you lock the door eliminate that risk of this thing coming open so now we take a band we run it through the loop and then we run it through itself it's called the lark knot and that is how we anchor the band now we can come over we can do all sorts of different exercises exercise i can do rows i could do biceps here and depending on where we anchor the band we can get different angles so for example right here we've got something that's close to chest height if i were to put it over the top of the door now we can do things like triceps push downs we can do lat pull downs anything from a high angle and of course we can do the opposite we can go low and we can do biceps curls different things now here's one of the things common questions that i get they say well how do i keep the door anchor first from sliding up and down the door so if you're doing a high anchor point and you're pulling down you don't want to do it on the side of the door because as you pull of course it's going to want to slide down same thing if you're anchoring low it's going to want to pull up so anchor over the top of the door or go underneath the door so make sure any of those low points or high points are going to the top of the door bottom of the door anything else you can go if it's pretty much from let's say mid thigh to shoulder height then you're definitely going to want to anchor it on the side of the door now going back to what we were talking about with linear variable resistance just wanted to show you the door anchor here our third way of creating more resistance again is stretching the band but now we're going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i'm creating more resistance let's say that i'm in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that's too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little bit of the band slip through my hand and i can adjust again is stretching the band but now we're going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i'm creating more resistance let's say that i'm in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that's too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little years ago and that's why i prefer these over the tube style bands okay now there's a couple variations when it comes to adjusting our foot position or hand position so let me show you those real quick so let me grab this extra light band now a lot of the big guys are like what am i going to use an extra light band for but trust me if you use it the right way for certain exercises this band is very helpful i use this band a lot so here's a good example let's say we want to do side raises for shoulders here when it comes to side raise i don't just want resistance in a vertical plane ideally i would like resistance at this angle right here so what i can do if i'm going to do it on my right side anchor it under my right foot now i'm going to step on it with my left grab it with my right now look at this angle of pull right here so not only am i adjusting my resistance level but i can change the direction of it which is one of the nice things about resistance band training again is having resistance in different planes now if i take bands again whether i anchor them over there on the door or use a a pull-up bar same thing i can change my angle of pull now as i curl this up right there at the peak of the contraction i've got maximum resistance and that's what you want when you're building muscle you want to activate as many muscle fibers as possible and so that's why those good squeezes at the top it's like an isometric contraction are very important and having maximum resistance at the peak of that contraction is really important so each side and you say well i'm ready to jump up and so you put another plate on each side and that's 225 well we can do the same thing with bands and that's simply just adding bands together and all you want to do try to lay them as flat as possible but don't try to micromanages it's not a big deal if there's little twists in them you just anchor them under your feet and there you go now you just increase the resistance level and now you have even more flexibility because you can do the same things is why i recommend gloves now i went 20 plus years of working out in the gym with free weights never ever using gloves when it comes to resistance bands i always use them because just the texture of them as they stretch it creates a lot of friction so you don't want to take the skin off your hand as far as style of glove look you can go to any auto parts store you can get full fingered gloves and they'll work i actually designed a set of gloves here that has padding on the inside of the thumb and the outside when it comes to these tube style bands it's a double-edged sword like most things in life the handles are convenient they're nice but by the time you add up the handles the metal rings the metal carabiners through all your different levels of resistance it adds a lot of weight and i found that when i was using these they were too bulky and they were too heavy one of the things i like about these especially with the five different levels of resistance which is all i've been working out with for the sometimes it's difficult to juggle all those things and fit your work out into your schedule so let's imagine it's a long day you didn't get your workout in the morning you tell yourself all day long i'm gonna go to the gym in the afternoon but all of a sudden five o'clock rolls around you go home you go you change your clothes put your gym clothes on you go oh man i gotta get in the car i gotta drive to the gym so for me the 15 minutes of driving to the gym and then parking and the 15 minutes driving something this big and clunky and heavy i wanted light and uh and compact so moving on so we covered linear variable resistance what that is and what the resistance levels are how to adjust the resistance level which brings me to the next common question which is where do i start which band do i pick up you know do i do i start my biceps exercises with the heavy do i go to the extra heavy best advice i can give you is you need to change the way that you think one of the common mistakes that i see people making a gym so even if you're and you take yourself to fail you're only using good form not at the cost of doing cheat reps in bad form but now conversely what if you come in the next week and you feel stronger than the previous week you did 10 reps last week but now all of a sudden you get to 10 and you feel like you've got you know maybe three reps left in your gas tank do you just stop at 10 no you keep going you push yourself and that is training by feel that's learning to know what your limits are and pushing yourself to that benefits of the linear variable resistance and being able to adjust on the fly because you can start off harder if you want to let's say you're going for 10 reps do the first five and do them really hard and if you can't get the rest like i said adjust your your foot position or your distance to anchor point or your hand position lessen the resistance a little finish out your set but finish it strong so those are all the key points with getting started with resistance bands now there's a lot of questions of how bands compare to gym what do you need well you need a bench why because with free weights you only have one plane of resistance which is the vertical plane because we are pressing against gravity so in other words to train our chest we have to lay on our back so we can press straight up with bands we don't need that because we have resistance in multiple planes because the resistance or the tension created isn't from gravity but it's from the band itself so now we can stand up and we can press in front of us we can press up above we strength this is a functional strength and that's one of the things that i really like about resistance bands\""}, {"id": 1017,
