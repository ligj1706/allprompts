Our history makes cynicism and refusal to be one big easy target a survival trait handed down from generation to generation. Black people born in America never got to see Black people united like African and Haitians. Division kept our labor cheap, uprisings down and power non-existent.      So this Web3 community push seems lost on the culture, but we were built for this and don't know it yet. Our history is full of us developing our societies within American society specifically for us like Black clubs, Black barbershops, Black beauty salons. Our mothers traded knowledge that kept us fed on shoe string budgets (fried food kept longer) and our leaders were made in secret least they be targeted. Our hood is one big \"Decentralized Autonomous Organization\" with its own economy and justice in spite of America's society.      Our secret societies were demonized, our ways seen as savage, until they were copied and made mainstream. Been that way since the dancing in juke joints was seen as savage and deviant until Elvis, backwards hats was seen as thuggish and ghetto at first, before \"bling\" was in a Zales commercial, it was seen as the reason why Black people stay impoverished and Lil Wayne complained about it in a song. I'm old enough to remember when rap was evil and the cause of the crack epidemic. Eminem is compared to Elvis for a reason.  The Cool Factor  This leads me to Black Twitter, you see in 2009, Twitter was barely getting celebrities to buy into it. 3rd party apps were allowed to keep developers as users. Then Black people like me used the open space to promote our podcasts, developed fans and networked as a community. We did things like fake RT, set a community standard that after midnight explicit tweets were allowed and our network grew. Mobile app developers created an entire market around it.      Live tweets? We used to call it \"watching a show as a family\". Our reaction to Game of Throne's Red Wedding episode, my favorite Black Twitter event ever, made that show a global phenomenon. My Game of Thrones shirt that I wore to a beach party got a lot of attention from female book fans that saw their fandom get a credibility boost. The ladies I attended the party had to pull me away and later joked that \"Pam\" was two drinks away from asking to see my dragon. By the season finale of the show, the author had to write a new book for the new audience and HBO's spinoff is on it's 3rd episode as I type this.      Black Twitter: Influence goes Global      Black Twitter made Empire, Blackish, Scandal and Black Jesus ratings juggernauts. Marvel's Civil War movie saw Black Twitter choose sides with hashtags and #TeamCap claiming victory. #TeamCap also claims credit for the scene with Black Panther and Captain America in Avengers: Endgame. HBO's Insecure's star used to be the Insecure Black Girl account on Black Twitter. Quinta Brunson also went from the TL to her own sitcom. Black Panther became a such a global phenomenon that Marvel's rival DC still hasn't recovered. Captain America's portal scene with Black Panther in Endgame was their thanks to the culture for some. DC looked so uncool and white that Batman roast sessions were common on Twitter.     Black Lives Matter sentiment hit Batman who was seen as an overzealous cop and a privileged rich white kid they couldn't relate to instead of the caped crusader who targeted anonymous thugs and supervillains. Black Twitter's roast sessions were acknowledged in a Batman movie, DC's best PR move.    Black Twitter: Unpaid Innovators      Now imagine all of our creativity that made networks rich being harnessed and sold as a community with payment automatically distributed according to contribution and each transaction down to the penny being publicly available. Rap labels without the embezzlement or bad contracts, equal pay for men and women, no Black leaders or religion, and a win for one is a win for all. My viral video just gave the community more promotion and more eyes for your music label who's album cover was part of an NFT collection that is more valuable now for all the token holders.      Class is video and audio based with 5 minutes being seen as too long. Not only does graduation increase your skills, your cap can also be used as a coupon for discounts and a badge to post on Facebook to make mama proud. \"Decentralized\" as in segregated and secured networks like your home Wifi, not like your phone company's network. \"Autonomous\" just means we rule and sustain our own people and \"Organization\" means we're a collective, a community, a Metaverse gang with our own hood that we built and own ourselves.

But the Department of Homeland Security, parent agency of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, has opened discussions with the Pentagon about delaying their departure until late January, according to an official who was not authorized to speak on the record.\nIf approved, the extension would represent another expansion of the military border operation, whose scope has steadily grown since President Trump rushed troops to border posts in Arizona, Texas and California shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm election.\nAn extension would keep troops away from home through the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, which would intensify criticism of the operation from Democrats, who have called the operation wasteful and unnecessary.\nOnly last week, the White House authorized troops along the border to detain, search, and if necessary use deadly force to protect other U.S. government personnel, a major change in the military role but one that Pentagon officials insisted would only be employed in dire emergencies.\nThousands of migrants are in the Mexican cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. Some clashed earlier this week at the San Ysidro border crossing with Border Patrol agents, who fired tear gas to prevent them from seeking to rush the border en masse. Unarmed U.S. troops were seen moving razor wire to block the attempted crossing.\nIf the mission is extended, one official said, the Pentagon could rotate new troops to the border and send some personnel who have been living in makeshift camps since October back to their home bases.\nThe Defense Department has sought to keep tight limits on the border operation. At the same time, other administration officials who advocate aggressive efforts to block immigration have sought to expand the military role to buttress the president’s incendiary charges that caravans of migrants moving north through Mexico pose an imminent threat to U.S. security.\nThe Homeland Security department has not made a formal request for an extension, Pentagon officials said.\nDefense Secretary James N. Mattis told reporters Wednesday the two departments were in discussions about whether an extension was required.\nMattis added that the troops had largely completed their original mission of strengthening protections with razor wire fences and vehicle barriers at dozens of legal border crossings, known as ports of entry.\nThat could lead commanders of the operation to send home engineering and logistics troops who have been installing the additional barriers. Military police who would be called on in case of a riot or other large-scale attempt to cross the border would likely remain, along with support troops, helicopter units and other specialized troops.\nIt’s unclear whether the overall size of the force would shrink if an extension were approved.\nMattis played down the possibility that troops could be involved in use of force against migrants, saying the Border Patrol had shown its capability of securing the border without direct involvement by troops.\nMattis did not address why the troops would need to stay on the border if the Border Patrol could handle security.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you provide a summary of the potential extension of U.S. troops along the southwest border and the reactions it has received from Democrats?"}, {"id": 1908, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "Next Question: Premise: \"A team of canadian hockey players is sitting together.\"\nHypothesis: \"Sports players on the same team are sitting nearby.\"\nDo we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\nMy Answer: Let's think.
