The testimony offered by the smoker’s other expert regarding cigarette design and the increased risk of one type of cancer was “new” and, thus, irrelevant. The court also refused to exclude the manufacturer’s “empty chair” arguments which attributed fault to non-party cigarette companies (Dover v R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., September 19, 2014, Scheindlin, S.).\nBackground. The smoker, Penny Dover, developed coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) allegedly as a result of smoking cigarettes. She filed an action against a number of tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, asserting claims for strict liability, civil conspiracy to fraudulently conceal, fraudulent concealment, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of express and implied warranties. The issues, pursuant to Phase II of the Engle trial plan, were limited to specific causation, apportionment of damages, comparative fault, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. Before the court were preliminary motions in limine and Daubert challenges to the admissibility of certain expert testimony.\nIncreased risk of cancer. The tobacco companies sought to exclude the testimony by one of the smoker’s experts, who was expected to testify regarding the effect that changes in cigarette design have had on the risk of developing adenocarcinoma, a type of lung cancer. The smoker countered that the testimony was relevant in determining any allocation of fault because the conduct of all the tobacco companies contributed to her smoking-related injuries. The smoker also claimed that the testimony was needed to rebut the tobacco companies’ contention that she knew of the risks of smoking.\nThe court agreed with the tobacco companies. The theory that changes in cigarette design increased risk of adenocarcinoma was new, having been articulated within the last year in the 2014 Surgeon General’s Report on the health consequences of smoking. Thus, the evidence was not relevant to notice or to the tobacco company’s alleged failure to act based on that notice. It was also not relevant to the smoker’s punitive damages claim, which required convincing evidence that the tobacco companies had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct, nor was it relevant to the smoker’s strict liability claim because she did not claim that she was suffering from any form of lung cancer. Thus, the evidence was irrelevant in establishing a causal link between the conduct of the tobacco companies and her injuries. Finally, the probative value of this evidence in establishing that the smoker would not have smoked or would have quit smoking despite her nicotine addiction if she had only known about the increased risk of this particular type of lung cancer was far outweighed by the potential for prejudice or confusion of the issues.\nMinimum effective dose. The tobacco companies also challenged the qualifications of the expert who was proffered to testify on the minimum effective dose theory (which states that “there is an effective dose range of nicotine necessary to initiate and sustain addiction”). A review of the expert’s education, professional qualifications, and professional work led the court to conclude that the expert was qualified to offer an opinion on addiction and the minimum effective dose of nicotine. The expert had spent years studying and compiling research to determine why people smoke, and his education and professional work included pharmacology, particularly with respect to the effects of nicotine. The expert had also published extensively on nicotine addiction and had served as senior editor on the 1988 Surgeon General’s Report on Nicotine Addiction. This background and training also qualified the expert to testify regarding the tobacco companies’ marketing strategies and the effects of cigarette advertising on the public.\n“Empty chair” arguments. In rejecting the smoker’s argument that the tobacco companies should be precluded from attempting to place fault with non-party tobacco companies whose liability had not been pleaded or proven, the court explained that the tobacco companies were entitled to use this evidence to rebut the smoker’s proof of causation by proving that she had smoked non-party brands. The tobacco companies also could use the evidence to impeach the smoker’s credibility to the extent that her sworn statements about smoking non-party brands contradicted or refuted the smoker’s claims that the design of the party tobacco companies’ cigarettes stopped her from quitting smoking.\nThe case number is 3:09-cv-11531(SAS).\nAttorneys: Charlie Easa Farah, Jr. (Farah & Farah, PA) for Penny Dover.

After all, why would criminals bother with guppies when they can net a whale, right? Wrong. Hackers are increasingly targeting small businesses, because they typically lack the security monitoring and management capabilities of larger companies.\nThe problem for small business owners is consumer grade security programs aren’t robust enough to protect a business infrastructure, but most smaller companies don’t have the IT resources to manage a business-class solution.\nBitdefender aims to bridge that gap with Small Office Security, a cloud-based suite that reduces the expense of IT maintenance and makes it easy for non-IT-professionals to manage and secure company computers.\nOnce you subscribe to Small Office Security ($143.50 per year for up to five seats), you login to a Web-based interface called Control Center. From here, you can manage antimalware on all PCs within your network, “roaming” laptop endpoints, and remote office endpoints. Although the security suite is cloud-based, each protected system receives a local program called Endpoint Security, which can be downloaded manually to each computer or remotely deployed from within the Control Center.\nThe main page of the Control Center features a dashboard that provides a status snapshot of your managed clients. It’s divided into four sections: Malware Activity, Malware Status, Top 10 Detected Malware, and Computer Protection Status. Each section displays a graph or a chart in varying shades of red and green to indicate how your network is faring. For example, the Malware Status section includes a pie chart that illustrates how many systems are infected, fixed, and completely clean. The Top 10 Detected Malware section features a bar graph that can help you identify if certain types of viruses are hitting your servers.\nIn addition to the dashboard, Control Center includes six other tabs from which you can install protection and manage settings, set and apply policies, run reports, remotely manage quarantined files, and check user activity logs. Administrators have full privileges, while employees have access only to network security and user management.\nSmall Office Security isn’t as Windows 8-ready as other suites we’ve seen. The Control Center utilizes non-touch-friendly dropdown menus, and it’s for desktops and laptops only—no mobile protection is offered through the suite. Because small businesses are especially likely to have employees using a variety of devices, including tablets and smartphones, at the office and on company time, it would have been good to see at least a nod to mobile security.\nFor our analysis of Small Office Security’s protection capabilities, we consulted independent data from AV-Test’s December 2013 test results. The security suite received a performance score of 6 (out of 6). This indicates the software is lightweight and easy on system resources, and will run in the background virtually unnoticed. This is especially critical for small businesses, as employee productivity won’t be compromised by sluggish machines, even if you happen to be remotely tinkering around in the Control Center.\nThe suite scored very well in AV-Test’s real-world protection tests, successfully blocking 100 percent of zero-day malware attacks (including Web threats). Although Bitdefender wasn’t included in our 2014 Security Showdown, this score puts it on par with other top security suites, including Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 and Symantec Norton Internet Security 2014 . Bitdefender also performed well on the malware zoo detection test, blocking 99 percent of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last four months of 2013. It didn’t flag any safe websites dangerous, and but it did falsely detect legitimate software as malware twice—slightly higher than average—during system scans.\nBitdefender Small Office Security is designed for companies with up to 250 seats, making it an attractive choice for small business owners looking to ramp up their network security. It offers great protection and performance with an easy-to-use interface that will keep company endpoints secure with a minimum of hassle."}, {"id": 6100, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "Can you provide an overview of the history of the internet?"}, {"id": 6101, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "Using an example, explain how a computer processes data.\nNoinput"}, {"id": 6102, "actor": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "prompt": "Can you crack this enigma and ascertain the veracious statement through intellectual deduction?

Not at all. We can talk about the virtual economy that is created by Ribā and the stock market. Numbers are overinflated and the wishful thinking of investors are culprits as well. All it takes is a slight loss in confidence.

What we are seeing today, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and others before it, are symptoms of the inherent problem.\nThe trouble started when money no longer carried any intrinsic value. Never in the history of man have we been in a situation in which money is literally created out of thin air by a cartel of private bankers. The Federal Reserve in the United States is not federal and it certainly has no reserves.\nBefore President Nixon's decision on August 15, 1971 to completely eliminate gold from the money equation, there was the gold exchange standard where money was tied to gold.\nBefore the gold exchange standard was the gold standard, and this was before the United States government, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, seized all gold from its citizens on March 9, 1933.\nConventional banking, which has its own history and development, is fueled by the modern fiat monetary system.\nBanks don't have money stored away. Money is created when banks give out loans. Money is created from debt!\nSo such collapses are not a surprise nor should they be.\nGold never gets old. If you have savings, invest them in gold coins outside of the grid. I mean go out and buy gold coins and store them away yourself.\nThe United States is bankrupt, and things will only get worse as time passes.\nIt is a blessing that I am in the process of writing my book on Ribā and Islamic banking. People in general, and Muslims in particular, have to have some foundational knowledge of how we came to the situation we are in today as far as the monetary system.\nWe have to know what is Sharī‘ah compliant and adhere to it.\nThose convenient Fatāwā about it being permissible to buy a house on a conventional mortgage in the West are not only fragile as far as their justifications and proofs, but as time continues, practical events will prove that there is nothing good about Ribā.\nA house bought with Ribā is a cursed house."}, {"id": 6142, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "give me a 20 minute kettlebell workout for shoulder and biceps. keep it simpleShare Prompt"}, {"id": 6143, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "With no explanation, chose the best option from \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Your task is to write a program that takes the time step (`dt`) and the size of the time array (`timei.size`) as input and outputs the corresponding `freq` array.\n\nThe `np.arange()` function is a NumPy function that creates an array of evenly spaced values within a given interval. It takes three parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`, where `start` is the starting value of the interval, `stop` is the value at which the interval ends (exclusive), and `step` is the step size between consecutive values.\n\nIn this problem, the `start` value is `-1/(2*dt)`, the `stop` value is `1/(2*dt)-1/(2*dt*timei.size)`, and the `step` value is `1/(dt*timei.size)`.\n\nWrite a program that takes two inputs: `dt` (the time step) and `timei.size` (the size of the time array). Your program should output the `freq` array defined in the given code snippet.\n\nNote: You can assume that `dt` and `timei.size` are positive integers."}]
