It is a condition that adversely affects an individual's functional abilities and level of independence by causing chronic impairment and is particularly prevalent in adults and the elderly. Based on Foo (as cited in the Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2010), the prevalence of KOA in Malaysia is estimated to be between 10% to 20% of the elderly population. The growing number of old or natural ageing, and higher body mass index (BMI), are the key factors contributing to KOA, as claimed by Wallace et al. (2017) However, it is common for adults and the elderly to develop knee discomfort or KOA as the cartilage that was supposed to act as a shock absorber for mechanical body weight-bearing movements gradually deteriorates. As a result, KOA can cause chronic progressive pain and disturb the patient’s functional ability. The loss of workforce and other psychological implications can affect a patient's professional life, entertainment, social life, and sleep pattern and significantly reduce the quality of life (QoL) of KOA patients (Askin et al., 2017). This study’s primary concern is to examine the use of manual therapy and exercise therapy in managing the symptoms of KOA, with the primary goal of improving functional ability. Typically, patients with KOA opt for medicine to alleviate pain, oblivious that an active lifestyle is equally required to manage the symptoms of KOA. Pharmaceutical therapies alone will not help patients with KOA improve their functional ability. Therefore, pharmacological therapies should be omitted in this systematic review study. This systematic review study will include all publications and journals describing the effects of manual treatment and exercise therapy on improving the functional ability of KOA patients. This study will then systematically review the medical literature that studied the critical role of manual therapy and exercise therapy as interventions to enhance functional ability and improve QoL. It is necessary to continue this study as the elderly population has a higher risk of developing KOA which cannot be avoided in the natural ageing process that will happen to everyone. Furthermore, Shamsi et al. (2021) studied that age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis will be significantly accelerated in emerging countries and will remain increase in the future, particularly in Asian countries.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nThe world-increasing trend of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total knee replacement, as claimed by Gao et al. (2020), is worrying. In the future, it is possible as KOA can be popular among adults as early as 30 years old. Most people would want surgical interventions immediately without opting for conservative treatments due to time constraints and non-adherence to exercises. Furthermore, in the early stage of KOA, surgery should not be an option; however, most patients with KOA would still not adhere to the manual therapy and exercise therapy that has been prescribed. Manual therapy and exercise therapy during that stage should greatly help manage KOA symptoms and prevent rapid deterioration, progressing KOA quicker to the severe stage. Even in the later stage, manual therapy and exercise therapy shall be part of the treatment options while seeking surgical interventions.\n\n1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThis systematic review study aims to disclose the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in improving KOA patients' pain and functional ability. The effectiveness of manual and exercise therapy can be measured using reliable outcome measures of pain and functional ability. A helpful guideline and assistance in advocating for the public to opt for manual therapy and exercise therapy to manage KOA symptoms will be a great success once the efficacy of these treatments has been\nproven.\n\n1.4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE(S)\n\nGeneral Objectives:\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in reducing pain and improving the functional ability of patients with KOA\n\nSpecific Objectives:\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in managing pain symptoms of KOA patients.\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in enhancing the functional ability of KOA patients.\n\n1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION(S)\n\nDoes manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively reduce the pain symptoms of patients with KOA?\nDoes manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively improve the functional ability of patients with KOA?\n\n1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nManual therapy and exercise therapy will reduce pain symptoms for KOA patients.\nManual therapy and exercise therapy will improve the functional ability of KOA patients.\n\n1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nSuppose this study aims to prove manual and exercise therapy's efficacy. In that case, it will be able to make a guideline for health professionals and the public, especially for individuals with KOA. Moreover, a solid guideline can advocate for the public and raise awareness of the conservative treatments they may seek to control the KOA symptoms, especially those in the early stage, and could prevent arthroplasty or joint replacement. Naturally, the human with pain perception will avoid moving; however, it is possible to move the body while in pain with the proper technique. Besides that, manual therapy is also there to help individuals with KOA reduce pain through the hands of health professionals. This study is not solely for individuals with KOA but is also great for those who aim to slow down the natural-ageing degeneration process, which leads to KOA.\n\n1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1.8.1 Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)\n\nKnee osteoarthritis is a degenerative disorder of articular cartilage. It includes the pathology of wide tissues such as the meniscus, synovial membrane, and subchondral bone constituting the knee joint, ligament, joint capsule, tendon, and muscle (Kanamoto et al., 2020).\n\n1.8.2 Manual Therapy\n\nManual therapy is an advanced speciality area of physical therapy based on manual examination and treatment techniques integrated with exercise, patient education, and other physical therapy modalities to address pain, loss of function, and wellness. American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists (AAOMPT) Description of Advanced Specialty Practice (DASP) (2018) as cited from Physiopedia.\n\n1.8.3 Exercise Therapy\n\nExercise therapy consists of movements and physical activities that increase strength and function and reduce discomfort. (Australian Sports Physiotherapy, 2021)\n\n1.9 CHAPTER SUMMARY\n\nThe chapter started with a background study on KOA and manual therapy and exercise therapy as part of interventions done to improve individuals’ functional ability and continued with problem statements and the purpose of the study. Afterwards, this chapter presents the research objectives, questions, and hypothesis, guiding this systematic review study in assessing related articles and providing relevant and solid studies concerning the research's objectives, questions, and hypothesis. It then proceeded with the significance of the study to emphasise why it should be done and, lastly, explain the terms that are primarily used in this research."}, {"id": 7133, "actor": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet that involves plotting and visualizing the loss values of a model during training. Your task is to complete the code snippet by uncommenting the necessary line(s) of code and modifying the code to correctly display the loss values.\n\nWrite a function `plot_loss(history)` that takes a dictionary `history` as its input. The `history` dictionary contains two keys: `'loss'` and `'val_acc'`. The value associated with the `'loss'` key is a list of floating-point numbers representing the loss values of the model at each epoch during training. The value associated with the `'val_acc'` key is a list of floating-point numbers representing the validation accuracy of the model at each epoch during training.

Use the given sentence, \"The more you try to reach the end, the farther away it seems\", and represent it in [Latex] format to show how it creates a paradoxical situation. Additionally, provide two other examples of paradoxical situations in literature and explain their significance.\nSolution:\nA paradox is a literary device that uses contradictory statements or situations to create a sense of confusion or intrigue. In the given sentence, \"The more you try to reach the end, the farther away it seems\", the paradox lies in the fact that the more effort one puts in to achieve something, the more distant the goal appears. This can be represented mathematically as:\nd = k/e\nWhere 'd' is the perceived distance, 'k' is a constant, and 'e' is the effort put in. As 'e' increases, 'd' also increases, resulting in a paradoxical situation.\nTwo other examples of paradoxical situations in literature are:\n1. In Shakespeare's play, Hamlet, the protagonist says, \"I must be cruel only to be kind\". This is paradoxical because being cruel and being kind are contradictory actions, yet they are being used together to achieve a common goal.\n2. In George Orwell's Animal Farm, the pigs declare that \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\". This is paradoxical because the idea of equality is being contradicted by the phrase \"more equal than others\", creating a sense of confusion and irony."}, {"id": 7182, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "Can you list 5 south african competitors to www.yoco.com ?"}, {"id": 7183, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "In TypeScript, how can I tell the type system \"I know that in theory this value may have these multiple types, but in practice I know it will only have this one\""}, {"id": 7184, "actor": "Software Development & Music", "prompt": "What is the difference between Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratio?"}, {"id": 7185, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "give me a lot of names of monster girls, then put the traditional chinese translation near by the name you give me, but i don't need the Pinyin like (Mèi mó)"}, {"id": 7186, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "is an amplifier the same as a signal generator?"}, {"id": 7187, "actor": "Data Handling & Parsing Techniques", "prompt": "You are working on a Python program that processes data related to a senate and logs any exceptions that occur during execution.

This function takes two parameters: `senate` (a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a senator) and `logfile` (a string representing the path to the log file).\n\nYou need to implement the following steps in the `process_data` function:\n\n1. Create a try-except block to handle any exceptions that occur during execution.
