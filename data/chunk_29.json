Your task is to understand the code and identify the purpose and functionality of each function.\n\n- The `groupByRace` function takes a parameter `list` of type `TierList`. It iterates over the keys of `list` using the `reduce` function. For each key, it retrieves the corresponding value from `list`. The value is stored in the `minions` variable. The function then groups the `minions` by their `race` property using the `groupBy` function from the lodash library. The result is stored in an object `acc`, with the `race` as the key and the grouped `minions` as the value. The `acc` object is updated with each iteration and eventually returned as the final result.\n\n- The unnamed function within the `groupByRace` function is used as the callback function for the `groupBy` function. It maps `value` to `value.race`. If `value.race` is `null` or `undefined`, it is mapped to the string `'INVALID'`.\n\n- The `getTierCN` function takes a parameter `techLevel` of type `number`. It uses a `switch` statement to check the value of `techLevel`. Depending on the value, the function executes different code paths, but the code snippet is incomplete and lacks the cases and code blocks after the initial case.\n\nYour task is to complete the `getTierCN` function by adding the missing cases and code blocks for all possible values of `techLevel`. Each case should return a descriptive string that represents the corresponding tier in a game. The tier descriptions should follow the pattern `Tier X`, where `X` is the value of `techLevel`. The output should be in lowercase.\n\nWrite a function named `verifyTier` that takes a single parameter `techLevel` (a positive integer) and returns the description of the corresponding tier according to the rules described above.\n\nFunction signature: `function verifyTier(techLevel: number): string`\n\n**Examples**\nExample 1:\n```javascript\nverifyTier(1)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\"tier 1\"\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```javascript\nverifyTier(4)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\"tier 4\"\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```javascript\nverifyTier(7)\n```\nOutput:\n```\n\"tier 7\"\n```"}, {"id": 29119, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "My wife and I are going to Austin for 3 days and are looking for suggestions on things to do.

Primarily, our interests lie in the neural collapse (NC) phenomena (Papyan et. al 2020) where the last layer representations (embeddings) and the weights of the classification head align and form an equiangular tight frame (ETF) structure. The NC phenomena was first characterized and analyzed for neural networks optimized with Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss. However, recent work has shown that the ETF structure is the optimal geometry for SCL (Graf et al. 2021). Our hope is to fill in the gaps by approaching the problem from an optimization perspective. With this, we see potential in characterizing the geometry once again as an ETF but in addition we will analyze the data-imbalanced setting akin to what was recently accomplished for CE (Thrampoulidis et al. 2022). This approach has a few advantages: (a) we would be able to apply an established optimization framework in order to further understand SCL; (b) it offers the potential to explore modified geometries due to added constraints, such as those imposed by some modern neural networks. Modern deep learning has been moving towards larger models like Transformers trained via unsupervised means, furthermore, recent works have suggested an increased robustness to distributional imbalances in this setting. This work provides a stepping stone in understanding the implicit geometry of unsupervised settings through understanding self-similarity metrics like SCL which are at the core of unsupervised learning."}, {"id": 29158, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "brainstorm 10 ideas for paper topics related to Shakespeare's king lear"}, {"id": 29159, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "Code for a web view link to detect OS and redirect to mobile app installed"}, {"id": 29160, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write an essay in which you reflect on a moment in your life when you had to make a difficult sacrifice for someone you loved.

The code snippet shows a conditional statement that determines whether to turn off the AC based on certain conditions.\n\nYour task is to implement a function, `should_turn_off_ac`, that takes in two parameters:\n1. `now` (integer): the current time in seconds elapsed since a reference timestamp.\n2. `alarm_start` (integer): the time in seconds elapsed since the reference timestamp when the alarm was started.\n\nThe reference timestamp is a fixed point in time against which the `now` and `alarm_start` times are measured.\n\nThe function should return a boolean value indicating whether the AC system should be turned off. The rules for turning off the AC are as follows:\n\n- If the time elapsed between the `alarm_start` and the `now` is greater than the threshold value `MIN_TIME_TURN_OFF_AC` (a constant), the AC should be turned off, regardless of any other conditions.\n\n- If the elapsed time is not greater than the threshold, but the `critical_alarm_state` is `True`, meaning the AC system is currently in a critical alarm state, the AC should be turned off.\n\n- If neither of the above conditions is met, the AC should remain on.\n\nImplement the function `should_turn_off_ac(now: int, alarm_start: int) -> bool` to solve the problem. Assume that `MIN_TIME_TURN_OFF_AC` and `critical_alarm_state` are accessible variables within the program but are not parameters of the `should_turn_off_ac` function.\n\nYou can assume that the input values for `now` and `alarm_start` are always non-negative integers.\n\nExample:\n```\nMIN_TIME_TURN_OFF_AC = 1800\ncritical_alarm_state = False\n\nassert should_turn_off_ac(3600, 900) == True\nassert should_turn_off_ac(900, 900) == False\nassert should_turn_off_ac(1800, 900) == False\nassert should_turn_off_ac(1800, 1800) == False\nassert should_turn_off_ac(2700, 900) == False\n```"}, {"id": 29163, "actor": "Generative Art & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "show python code examples using slack conversations.replies"}, {"id": 29164, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "a species that has an essential role in maintaining ecosystem structure is called a"}, {"id": 29165, "actor": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "prompt": "Please provide a JSON data with the names of 5 famous fashion designers.\nRewritten prompt:\nI need a list of 5 famous fashion designers in JSON format.

We start by adding the starting node to the queue with a distance of 0, and then repeatedly remove the node with the shortest distance from the queue, updating the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\nTo apply Dijkstra's algorithm to our problem, we can represent the graph as a matrix where each cell represents a node and the value of the cell represents the weight of the edge between the nodes. We can then use the coordinates of the points A and B to find their corresponding nodes in the matrix and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between them.\nWhat is the matrix representation of the graph and the shortest route from point A to point B using Dijkstra's algorithm?"}, {"id": 29211, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "Explain me the anarchy theories of the past century and then of this century"}, {"id": 29212, "actor": "Data Handling & Parsing Techniques", "prompt": "What is the final price of this item with a 25% discount applied, given its original price is $100?\n[Rewritten Prompt with JSON data and code]: \n{\n    \"original_price\": 100,\n    \"discount_percent\": 25\n}\nTo calculate the final price after the discount, you can use the following JSON code:\n{\n    \"final_price\": ${original_price - (original_price * discount_percent / 100)}\n}\nThe final price would be $75."}, {"id": 29213, "actor": "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "prompt": "Can you identify the underlying factors that might be responsible for the inadequate performance of an AI algorithm?

Deep down, he may wonder about their fates and whether he'll ever see them again.\nFlaws:\n\nCowardice: When faced with serious consequences or confrontation, Jean-Baptiste has a tendency to flee rather than face his problems head-on.\n\nBiography:\nJean-Baptiste DuBois was born into a minor noble family in a beautiful coastal region reminiscent of the Mediterranean. As the eldest son, he was groomed to inherit the family estate and title. Educated in hunting, swordsmanship, poetry, and diplomacy, Jean-Baptiste preferred chasing romantic interests and engaging in mischief with the servants' children.\n\nHis parents arranged his marriage to Aurelie, the daughter of an influential merchant family. After Aurelie became pregnant, Jean-Baptiste felt trapped and abandoned his wife and unborn child. He joined a merchant ship, only to find himself lured into a life of piracy. Eventually, he fled the pirate crew after a confrontation with the captain.\n\nJean-Baptiste now wanders the world as a rogue, seeking adventure and evading his past. He harbors guilt for abandoning his family and wonders about their fate. His desire for freedom clashes with his longing for love and stability. Skilled in stealth, deception, and persuasion, Jean-Baptiste's weakness is his cowardice. The choices you make as Jean-Baptiste will shape his destiny and the lives of those he encounters.\n\nThe story so far:\nThe setting of the campaign has a Mediterranean theme with a fantasy twist, fitting with the general lore of Dungeons and Dragons. The story takes place in the coastal town of Sirena's Call. I have just successfully completed a heist, retrieving the Eye of the Kraken from the mansion of a wealthy merchant named Horatio de Vallo.\n\nDuring the heist, I acquired additional loot, including a golden necklace with a sapphire pendant and a small golden dragon statuette.

Now, I'm considering my next move and looking for new opportunities and adventures in the world.\n\nAs the Dungeon Master, please provide me with choices, challenges, and opportunities to make decisions, and guide me through a mixture of roleplaying, exploration, and combat.

It offers exceptional ease of use and a bagful of tricks for optimizing and improving your email campaigns. Representing a major component of your marketing technology stack, are you utilizing all of the features and functionality MailChimp has to offer?\nOne of the reasons we recommend MailChimp to customers who will be managing their own email marketing campaigns is because it's one of the most user-friendly tools out there for this. In fact, if you receive our monthly newsletter, you've probably already noticed that we use it in-house, too.\nAs recently as 2009, studies showed that email was the most popular online activity, favored by 87% of North Americans as their primary online communication tool. As marketers, email is a quick way to communicate directly with customers.\nWe met with a new client recently who runs a brick and mortar retail store, and with the help of a Magento ecommerce solution we'll be implementing for them, they will soon be reaching a bigger market online.\nFor most of us today, email is an essential part of both our personal and work lives. If we don't check our email for a few days, we probably feel lost. And if we don't receive any emails for a day, we think something's wrong.\nHow Do I Set Up Outlook/Email On My Computer?\nEmail can make your life easier, but only if you're able to send and receive it without problems.\nWe've already told you all the great things you can find out about your marketing results with Internet marketing and website tracking, but internet marketing gives you control even before you decide exactly what message you're going to market.\nInternet marketing is often a mysterious topic that business owners face with skepticism.

The testimony offered by the smoker’s other expert regarding cigarette design and the increased risk of one type of cancer was “new” and, thus, irrelevant. The court also refused to exclude the manufacturer’s “empty chair” arguments which attributed fault to non-party cigarette companies (Dover v R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., September 19, 2014, Scheindlin, S.).\nBackground. The smoker, Penny Dover, developed coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) allegedly as a result of smoking cigarettes. She filed an action against a number of tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, asserting claims for strict liability, civil conspiracy to fraudulently conceal, fraudulent concealment, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of express and implied warranties. The issues, pursuant to Phase II of the Engle trial plan, were limited to specific causation, apportionment of damages, comparative fault, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. Before the court were preliminary motions in limine and Daubert challenges to the admissibility of certain expert testimony.\nIncreased risk of cancer. The tobacco companies sought to exclude the testimony by one of the smoker’s experts, who was expected to testify regarding the effect that changes in cigarette design have had on the risk of developing adenocarcinoma, a type of lung cancer. The smoker countered that the testimony was relevant in determining any allocation of fault because the conduct of all the tobacco companies contributed to her smoking-related injuries. The smoker also claimed that the testimony was needed to rebut the tobacco companies’ contention that she knew of the risks of smoking.\nThe court agreed with the tobacco companies. The theory that changes in cigarette design increased risk of adenocarcinoma was new, having been articulated within the last year in the 2014 Surgeon General’s Report on the health consequences of smoking. Thus, the evidence was not relevant to notice or to the tobacco company’s alleged failure to act based on that notice. It was also not relevant to the smoker’s punitive damages claim, which required convincing evidence that the tobacco companies had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct, nor was it relevant to the smoker’s strict liability claim because she did not claim that she was suffering from any form of lung cancer. Thus, the evidence was irrelevant in establishing a causal link between the conduct of the tobacco companies and her injuries. Finally, the probative value of this evidence in establishing that the smoker would not have smoked or would have quit smoking despite her nicotine addiction if she had only known about the increased risk of this particular type of lung cancer was far outweighed by the potential for prejudice or confusion of the issues.\nMinimum effective dose. The tobacco companies also challenged the qualifications of the expert who was proffered to testify on the minimum effective dose theory (which states that “there is an effective dose range of nicotine necessary to initiate and sustain addiction”). A review of the expert’s education, professional qualifications, and professional work led the court to conclude that the expert was qualified to offer an opinion on addiction and the minimum effective dose of nicotine. The expert had spent years studying and compiling research to determine why people smoke, and his education and professional work included pharmacology, particularly with respect to the effects of nicotine. The expert had also published extensively on nicotine addiction and had served as senior editor on the 1988 Surgeon General’s Report on Nicotine Addiction. This background and training also qualified the expert to testify regarding the tobacco companies’ marketing strategies and the effects of cigarette advertising on the public.\n“Empty chair” arguments. In rejecting the smoker’s argument that the tobacco companies should be precluded from attempting to place fault with non-party tobacco companies whose liability had not been pleaded or proven, the court explained that the tobacco companies were entitled to use this evidence to rebut the smoker’s proof of causation by proving that she had smoked non-party brands. The tobacco companies also could use the evidence to impeach the smoker’s credibility to the extent that her sworn statements about smoking non-party brands contradicted or refuted the smoker’s claims that the design of the party tobacco companies’ cigarettes stopped her from quitting smoking.\nThe case number is 3:09-cv-11531(SAS).\nAttorneys: Charlie Easa Farah, Jr. (Farah & Farah, PA) for Penny Dover.

After all, why would criminals bother with guppies when they can net a whale, right? Wrong. Hackers are increasingly targeting small businesses, because they typically lack the security monitoring and management capabilities of larger companies.\nThe problem for small business owners is consumer grade security programs aren’t robust enough to protect a business infrastructure, but most smaller companies don’t have the IT resources to manage a business-class solution.\nBitdefender aims to bridge that gap with Small Office Security, a cloud-based suite that reduces the expense of IT maintenance and makes it easy for non-IT-professionals to manage and secure company computers.\nOnce you subscribe to Small Office Security ($143.50 per year for up to five seats), you login to a Web-based interface called Control Center. From here, you can manage antimalware on all PCs within your network, “roaming” laptop endpoints, and remote office endpoints. Although the security suite is cloud-based, each protected system receives a local program called Endpoint Security, which can be downloaded manually to each computer or remotely deployed from within the Control Center.\nThe main page of the Control Center features a dashboard that provides a status snapshot of your managed clients. It’s divided into four sections: Malware Activity, Malware Status, Top 10 Detected Malware, and Computer Protection Status. Each section displays a graph or a chart in varying shades of red and green to indicate how your network is faring. For example, the Malware Status section includes a pie chart that illustrates how many systems are infected, fixed, and completely clean. The Top 10 Detected Malware section features a bar graph that can help you identify if certain types of viruses are hitting your servers.\nIn addition to the dashboard, Control Center includes six other tabs from which you can install protection and manage settings, set and apply policies, run reports, remotely manage quarantined files, and check user activity logs. Administrators have full privileges, while employees have access only to network security and user management.\nSmall Office Security isn’t as Windows 8-ready as other suites we’ve seen. The Control Center utilizes non-touch-friendly dropdown menus, and it’s for desktops and laptops only—no mobile protection is offered through the suite. Because small businesses are especially likely to have employees using a variety of devices, including tablets and smartphones, at the office and on company time, it would have been good to see at least a nod to mobile security.\nFor our analysis of Small Office Security’s protection capabilities, we consulted independent data from AV-Test’s December 2013 test results. The security suite received a performance score of 6 (out of 6). This indicates the software is lightweight and easy on system resources, and will run in the background virtually unnoticed. This is especially critical for small businesses, as employee productivity won’t be compromised by sluggish machines, even if you happen to be remotely tinkering around in the Control Center.\nThe suite scored very well in AV-Test’s real-world protection tests, successfully blocking 100 percent of zero-day malware attacks (including Web threats). Although Bitdefender wasn’t included in our 2014 Security Showdown, this score puts it on par with other top security suites, including Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 and Symantec Norton Internet Security 2014 . Bitdefender also performed well on the malware zoo detection test, blocking 99 percent of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last four months of 2013. It didn’t flag any safe websites dangerous, and but it did falsely detect legitimate software as malware twice—slightly higher than average—during system scans.\nBitdefender Small Office Security is designed for companies with up to 250 seats, making it an attractive choice for small business owners looking to ramp up their network security. It offers great protection and performance with an easy-to-use interface that will keep company endpoints secure with a minimum of hassle."}, {"id": 29556, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "Can you provide an overview of the history of the internet?"}, {"id": 29557, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "Using an example, explain how a computer processes data.\nNoinput"}, {"id": 29558, "actor": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "prompt": "Can you crack this enigma and ascertain the veracious statement through intellectual deduction?

Not at all. We can talk about the virtual economy that is created by Ribā and the stock market. Numbers are overinflated and the wishful thinking of investors are culprits as well. All it takes is a slight loss in confidence.

What we are seeing today, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and others before it, are symptoms of the inherent problem.\nThe trouble started when money no longer carried any intrinsic value. Never in the history of man have we been in a situation in which money is literally created out of thin air by a cartel of private bankers. The Federal Reserve in the United States is not federal and it certainly has no reserves.\nBefore President Nixon's decision on August 15, 1971 to completely eliminate gold from the money equation, there was the gold exchange standard where money was tied to gold.\nBefore the gold exchange standard was the gold standard, and this was before the United States government, under President Franklin D Roosevelt, seized all gold from its citizens on March 9, 1933.\nConventional banking, which has its own history and development, is fueled by the modern fiat monetary system.\nBanks don't have money stored away. Money is created when banks give out loans. Money is created from debt!\nSo such collapses are not a surprise nor should they be.\nGold never gets old. If you have savings, invest them in gold coins outside of the grid. I mean go out and buy gold coins and store them away yourself.\nThe United States is bankrupt, and things will only get worse as time passes.\nIt is a blessing that I am in the process of writing my book on Ribā and Islamic banking. People in general, and Muslims in particular, have to have some foundational knowledge of how we came to the situation we are in today as far as the monetary system.\nWe have to know what is Sharī‘ah compliant and adhere to it.\nThose convenient Fatāwā about it being permissible to buy a house on a conventional mortgage in the West are not only fragile as far as their justifications and proofs, but as time continues, practical events will prove that there is nothing good about Ribā.\nA house bought with Ribā is a cursed house."}, {"id": 29598, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "give me a 20 minute kettlebell workout for shoulder and biceps. keep it simpleShare Prompt"}, {"id": 29599, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "With no explanation, chose the best option from \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".

Now, at 42, she's made fighting to end hateful dialogue her personal crusade. Speaking around the world on the issue (including a TED talk that has 6 million views), she stopped to talk to Glamour about what it will really take to change the virtual culture.\nOne Woman, Standing Up for Others: \"We may never fully stomp out hurtful online behavior,\" says Lewinsky. \"But I do believe we can get to a place where it's rarer and less harmful, specifically that a bully's words are drowned out by more supportive voices.\"\nGlamour: In our survey one out of five women admitted to criticizing a celebrity online. Is that disturbing to you?\nMonica Lewinsky: Constructive criticism is legitimate, but when it escalates to vitriol, it affects us all, because celebrities and influencers are part of the collective consciousness. Women need to support other women, not cut them down. And that goes for recognizable women too.\nGlamour: So how can women distinguish between criticizing and bullying?\nGlamour: Our survey also found that 57 percent of women reported receiving negative comments. Is Internet shaming the price of living in the fully wired 21st century?\nML: Acceptance of and adaptation to this deplorable behavior is not an option. Full stop. But as painful and destructive as they are, the hateful comments allow us to map the underlying beliefs of many people in a way we've never been able to before. It's almost as if all of the negativity and misogyny needs to come to the surface so we can fully understand what it is, and how deep it goes, before we can begin to shift it. Of course, I wish it weren't there.\nGlamour: So many women—even the most confident or accomplished—feel ashamed when we are confronted by cruel comments or critiques online. What advice would you give them?\nML: The first and most important thing sounds easy but can be challenging to do when we feel vulnerable: Reach out to someone—a friend, a relative, a mentor, or a professional—and share what happened. One reason I'm working with Bystander Revolution is precisely because it offers help in these situations. Feeling alone and unseen can intensify the experience of being harassed, shamed, or bullied. Also, if you can—and believe me, I know this is asking a lot—try and have neutral compassion toward the perpetrator. Step outside the sting of the incident and realize that this person is trying to erase their own inadequacy or unhappiness by transferring it to you. It won't make the incident go away, but it's one thing you can do to reduce the pain.\nGlamour: What can we all do to make the Internet a better place?\nML: The most potent thing we can do is to bring more compassion online. When you see anyone being targeted, support her or him with a positive comment or emoji. Be mindful of clickbait—sensational stories designed to humiliate.

But there are a smaller set of initiatives that represent big investment areas in 2022 to accelerate progress. These are outlined below, and will be how we communicate our priorities going forward:\n\nMake Reels successful. It’s critical to ensure people have great ways to create content and express themselves. Today’s genre of public short-form video opens up new ways for people to create and discover content. While Facebook’s discovery engine is designed to support many different formats (text, photos, video, and eventually Metaverse experiences), our biggest gap today is around short-form video and that’s why we’re focused on integrating Reels in Home, Watch, IFR, and Groups.\nBuild world-class recommendations technology. While we frequently talk about products people can see and use, the quality of what’s under the hood powering these experiences is more important than ever. Building a world-class recommendations system that is responsive to your interests, can identify trending content and original creators, and makes responsible recommendations while evaluating billions of pieces of content produced across Meta is an incredibly challenging technical problem. It’s a different problem than ranking the top content from the people, groups, or businesses you’re connected to and requires state-of-the-art technical innovation to succeed. We’re investing heavily in our Modern Recommendation Systems initiative with partners across the company to accelerate our work here.\nUnlock messaging-based sharing. Messaging apps have become an important venue for people to share and have conversations with smaller groups of friends and sub-communities. We’re also seeing shifts away from resharing content broadly via Feed and towards resharing content to smaller audiences in messaging apps. Given how much sharing and social interactions take place on messaging apps, it’s important that we integrate messaging experiences more fundamentally into how we enable people to connect and share on Facebook. To that end, we’re partnering with the Messenger team to enable an integrated inbox for more people on Facebook, revamping our sharing flows to enable better sharing to messaging apps across the board, and building community messaging experiences across Facebook and Messenger.\nWhile the efforts above are called out as priorities, it does not mean that other work across the organization isn’t important. Advancing all pillars of our strategy, ensuring Facebook is safe and enjoyable, supporting our revenue and engagement goals, and contributing to the broader set of Meta-level priorities require a strong portfolio of work across our organization. The reason the priorities above are highlighted is that these efforts represent the near-term, high-lift investments that we must accelerate to unlock foundational changes to how people will use Facebook over the next few years. They also represent some of the biggest - but also most challenging - opportunities for us to succeed with Young Adults. As top product priorities, we’ll communicate regularly about these and ensure that these areas and their dependencies receive the level of focus and investment required to succeed.\n\nLastly, I want to emphasize that in January we shared an aspiration to approach building products that are “Trustworthy,” “People-Centric,” and “Unified.” Rather than call these out as a discrete product priority, I want to emphasize that these are values we want to infuse into everything we build as part of the cultural change we’re making throughout the organization. I’ll continue to advocate for and highlight progress here across all of our teams.\nWhat's the conclusion?"}, {"id": 29616, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "generate medical surgery technobabble"}, {"id": 29617, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a poem about summer, specifically the smell of clean air, the feeling of birth and new chances in life and connecting it with appreciation to mothers.

A cline is a region where two color morphs of one species arrange themselves at opposite ends of an environmental gradient, with increasing mixtures occurring between. Such a cline exists near Liverpool, England, where a dark morph of a local moth has flourished in response to the blackening of tree trunks by air pollution from the mills. The moths are nocturnal, resting during the day on tree trunks, where their coloration acts as camouflage against predatory birds. In Liverpool, where tree trunks are blackened by smoke, a high percentage of moths are dark morph.

Make the language more polished and break into sections for better readability: I want to share the experience I had at Stanford Health so that others can take into condersation when making decisions about where to get spinal surgery done. Though I was happy with the surgeon, and surgical results, my experience for 5 days at Stanford Health where I never placed in a room or received specalized care was far from what I anticpated from a healthcare organization of Stanford’s stature. \n\nHaving had previous spinal fusions for scoliosis, I sort of know the drill. Upon meeting with several providers, I decided that Stanford would be the best fit for my needs especially since their website advertises that every patient gets a private room. When I had my first two surgeries, just over twenty years ago, I recall the post-op pain, physical therapy, lack of privacy (I had a shared room then) and so fourth being some of the obstables one has to face whlie in excuritating pain. Stanford claims they have wonderful patient care and getting a room was a given. I was wrong. \n\nI had surgery in late-November and while the procedure went well and I think the surgeon is amazing, the aftercare has left me still feeling anxious. I reached out to Stanford a week ago and haven’t heard back so I feel like it’s best to share my story more publicly.\n\nMy surgery was 8 hours and afterwards, I was placed in PACU (not totally unusual). I was told numerous times that they were trying to get a room for me as they knew I would be there for at least four nights. We asked every person who came behind the curtain that was the space where I was staying—contacted the doctors team—to no avail. I was left in PACU for four nights after having T10-Pelvis spinal fusion. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. \n\n1. PACU nurses aren’t trained on how to help individuals get out of a bed post-spine surgery. I had to explain how to log roll 9 out of 10 times and nurse came in. It got to the point that I would not call for assistance to use the bathroom because either the individual would put my bed into a “seating position” or they would take too long to come. \n2. PACU is for short-term stays. Staff do not discuss the needs of the patients there (i.e. when they’re switching shifts) so you are constantly asked the same quesitons over-and-over-and-over again i.e. “do you need to wear your brace when you go to the bathroom” (the answer is no, it was for PT to size it). \n3. The sheets were never changed during the four nights I was there\n4. My partner had to ask several times when I would go to the bathroom for someone to change my undermat as it was covered in blood from my incision pumps \n5. The pumps were not emptied regulary and would oventimes be full so I would ooze out onto my dressing gown \n6. They only changed my gown twice even though there was blood on it constantly \n7. Pain mangement was not explained thoroughly to me, I thought I only had two options. One gave me migraines, the other nausea so then I would chase down the symptoms with other medications. It was not until a nurse on the four night told me that there are numerous options that I was finally able to dial in what was best for me. \n\nWhile I understand that we live in a different world post-COVID, I do think this could have been handled better and not having an available over the span of 4 nights seems ridiculous. Instead of allowing me to move my location, I was told that they were canceling surgeries and I was lucky because people where in hallways. Whlie I didn’t see these poor patients, I doubt any of them had such a prodecure and a cathather which was prompty removed after a few hours and a surgery leaving them unable to walk to the bathroom. \n\nHaving experienced this, previous insight would have helped me making a decision regarding which hospital to use to help support me after such an intensive surgery."}, {"id": 29682, "actor": "Technology & Astrology", "prompt": "If Tetris pieces were people, what would their Zodiac signs would be?"}, {"id": 29683, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "Write a short story set in the world of Harry Potter, but Harry is a Leninist revolutionary waging class war against reactionary wizarding society."}, {"id": 29684, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "Bash line to recursively delete all folders called validation"}, {"id": 29685, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a full cute love story between a boy vampire named Adrian and a boy ghost named Leo about how hard the after life is with a happy ending and a kiss."}, {"id": 29686, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "Premise: \"A professional photographer is taking photos of possible newly discovered herbal medicines while talking to a local inhabitant.\"\nHypothesis: \"A person is taking photos for their business.\"\nIs the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\nOptions:\n- yes\n- it is not possible to tell\n- no Stream of thoughts:"}, {"id": 29687, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "Cats meow?"}, {"id": 29688, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "Can you describe the process and challenges of deep sea exploration and its significance for scientific research?"}, {"id": 29689, "actor": "Sustainable Packaging & Skin Care Products", "prompt": "Please write me a detailed description about the brand CTEK."}, {"id": 29690, "actor": "Entertainment & Politics", "prompt": "it's supposed to go like this:\n\n\"Too many requests in 1 hour.

To handle these exceptions gracefully, the application requires an emergency buffer that can be dynamically allocated whenever needed.\n\nYour task is to implement three functions: `alloc_emergency_exception_buf()`, `const()`, and `heap_lock()`.\n\n1. `alloc_emergency_exception_buf()`: This function should allocate an emergency buffer of sufficient size to hold exception information whenever an exceptional condition occurs. The size of the buffer should be determined based on the specific requirements of the application, which are beyond the scope of this task. You can assume that this function will be called only when there is sufficient memory available.\n\n2. `const()`: This function should return a constant value that can be used by the application to check if an emergency buffer has been allocated. The value returned by this function should remain constant throughout the execution of the program.\n\n3. `heap_lock()`: This function should lock the heap to prevent any other allocations or deallocations from occurring while an emergency buffer is being allocated. This will ensure the atomicity of the buffer allocation process. Once the buffer is allocated, the heap can be unlocked.\n\nYou need to implement these three functions in any programming language of your choice.\n\nNote:\n\n- The `alloc_emergency_exception_buf()` function should not return anything.\n- The `const()` function should not have any parameters and should return an integer value.\n- The `heap_lock()` function should not have any parameters and should not return anything.\n\nWrite the three functions in the language of your choice and test them with suitable inputs."}, {"id": 29723, "actor": "String Manipulation & Data Structures", "prompt": "As a teacher, you are tasked with creating a comprehensive learning plan that not only covers the core curriculum but also includes additional learning goals such as problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

Two weeks ago, we touched on how living behind the masks of who we think we are supposed to be can become our identity and that it keeps our light hidden. Last week we discussed boundaries – and becoming clear on our values, what is important to us, and sharing them with others creates space for our authentic selves to be expressed and known – clarifying our boundaries can build bridges through dialogue. \n\nToday we gather to explore some barriers that keep us from fully embracing our true selves.\n\nAs we navigate our journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth, we may encounter feelings of shame and unworthiness that prevent us from living our most authentic lives.\nThere is no way to talk about authenticity without addressing the elephant in the room: feelings of shame and unworthiness – which can keep us from even doing this work. Shame is universal in the human experience. It is the feeling that we are “not enough.” It is a fear of being unlovable that convinces us that if we work harder, change ourselves, keep some parts hidden from others and maybe, when we finally become enough, we will then be worthy of love and connection with others.\n\nLearning what shame is and what triggers shame for us, we will be able to recognize it and move through it with our worthiness. Shame can become a guide for us to the areas that we do not yet love and accept ourselves. It is in those areas we are seeking our worth through the approval of others. \n\nSWAN: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful swan that grew up amongst a flock of ducks. The swan had always felt different, unworthy, and ashamed, as it could not fit in with the ducks around it. It had been told all its life that it was an ugly duckling and that it would never be good enough.\n\nOne day, the swan came across a calm lake where it saw its reflection for the first time. To its surprise, it saw a beautiful, majestic swan staring back. In that moment, it realized that it had never been an ugly duckling; it was a swan, deserving of love and acceptance just as it was. This revelation allowed the swan to let go of the shame and unworthiness it had carried for so long and to embrace its true, authentic self.\n\nLike the swan, we all have inherent worth, as we are made in the image and likeness of the Divine. \n\nErnest Holmes writes, \"You belong to the universe in which you live, you are one with the Creative Genius back of this vast array of ceaseless motion, this original flow of life\" (This Thing Called You, Pg 3). Our worthiness is our birthright, and it is not dependent on external factors or the approval of others.\n\nHowever, shame and unworthiness can manifest in various ways and keep us from embracing our authentic selves. \nBrene Brown states, \"Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging\" (The Gifts of Imperfection, Pg. 39).\n\nHow do shame or unworthiness can prevent us from living authentically? \n1. Fear of expressing our true emotions: Shame may cause us to suppress our emotions and hide our authentic selves, fearing judgment or ridicule from others. \n2. Struggling with self-care: When we feel unworthy, we may neglect our physical, emotional, and mental well-being, believing that we don't deserve self-care. This can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and a disconnection from our authentic selves.\n3. Seeking validation from others: A sense of shame or unworthiness can cause us to rely on the approval and validation of others, rather than trusting our own instincts and values. This can result in inauthentic behavior, as we strive to please others and meet their expectations instead of living true to ourselves.\n\nTo release shame and unworthiness and embrace our authentic selves, we must first recognize and acknowledge these feelings. And for this reason we are discuss this today.\n\nErnest Holmes explains, \"When you stop condemning yourself, the condemnation of others will not reach you\" (New Horizons, 7). It's essential to confront these emotions, process them, and ultimately let them go.\n\nWhat are some actions we can take to help us release shame and unworthiness and embrace your authentic self. This morning I’ll offer you 4 as a starting place to support you:\n1. Create an inventory of your triggers: Awareness is the first step in transforming these feelings and reclaiming your power. Recognizing and understanding what triggers feelings of shame and unworthiness within you can help you face them head-on. \n2. Share your story with a trusted person: Brene Brown puts it, \"Shame needs three things to grow out of control in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgment… We need to share our experience; shame loses power when it is spoken\" (The Gifts of Imperfection, Pg. 40). Opening up about your feelings of shame and unworthiness to someone you trust can be a healing and empowering experience. In 12 step recovery, there is the 5th step where, “Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.” This vital exercise begins to provide emotional, mental and spiritual relief. By sharing wrong with a trusted confidant, guilt and shame start to melt away. \n3. Practice self-awareness and self-compassion: Mindfulness and meditation can help us develop greater self-awareness and foster self-compassion, and equanimity. Through understanding and embracing all aspects of yourself, including the parts you may feel ashamed or unworthy of, you can begin to cultivate authenticity and inner strength.\n4. Affirm your worthiness: Regularly remind yourself of your inherent worth through affirmations, such as \"I am worthy. I am loved. I am enough.\" Say this with me….This practice can help you internalize a sense of worthiness and reinforce your self-confidence.\n\nReleasing feelings of shame and unworthiness is a crucial step in embracing our authentic selves and living a life in alignment with our true nature. As we recognize, confront and process these emotions, we open ourselves up to a deeper sense of self-love, self-acceptance, and personal power.\n\nPrem Prakash, \"Our stresses, anxieties, pains, and problems arise because we do not see the world, others, or even ourselves as worthy of love\" (The Yoga of Spiritual Devotion: A Modern Translation of the Narada Bhakti Sutras). \n\nBy recognizing our inherent worthiness and shedding the shame and unworthiness that hold us back, we can fully embrace our authentic selves and live a life of love, connection, and joy.\n\nMay we all continue to support one another on this journey, and may we find the courage and strength to live our most authentic lives."}, {"id": 29797, "actor": "Prime Numbers & Mathematical Symbols", "prompt": "34591+321542452"}, {"id": 29798, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "List five specific techniques that designers can implement to optimize the accessibility of their designs for users with varying needs, such as color-blindness, hearing impairments, and mobility limitations.

The defendant contends that it is not liable for copyright infringement because it makes fair use of the Works in Suit. See 17 U.S.C. § 107. The parties now crossmove for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant’s motion for summary judgment is denied.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The plaintiffs -- Hachette Book Group, Inc. (“Hachette”), HarperCollins Publishers LLC (“HarperCollins”), John Wiley & Sons., Inc. (“Wiley”), and Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin”) (together, the “Publishers”) -- are four of the leading book publishers in the United States. Pls.’ 56.1, ECF No. 113, ¶ 1. They obtain from authors the exclusive rights to publish books in print and digital formats, including electronic copies of books, or “ebooks.” Id. ¶¶ 63-68. Publishers and authors generally are paid for sales of each format in which a book is published. Id. ¶ 65. The defendant, Internet Archive (“IA”), is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing “universal access to all knowledge.” Def.’s 56.1, ECF No. 98, ¶¶ 1-2. Brewster Kahle, IA’s Chairman, founded the organization in 1996. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 216. One of IA’s first projects was to document the history of the Internet by archiving every public webpage on the World Wide Web through IA’s “Wayback Machine.” Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 5. IA also works with libraries, museums, universities, and the public to preserve and offer free online access to texts, audio, moving images, software, and other cultural artifacts. Id. ¶ 6.\n\nThis dispute concerns the way libraries lend ebooks. Public and academic libraries in the United States spend billions of dollars each year obtaining print books and ebooks for their patrons to borrow for free. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 113. Libraries usually buy their print books from publishers or wholesalers. Id. ¶ 114. Copies of ebooks, however, are typically not bought but licensed to libraries from publishers through distributors called “aggregators.” Id. ¶ 117. The Publishers task aggregators with ensuring that a library lends its ebooks only to the library’s members. Id. ¶¶ 123, 125. The Publishers also require aggregators to employ approved “digital rights management” (“DRM”) software and other security measures to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of ebook files. Id. ¶ 126. Demand for library ebooks has increased over the past decade. In 2012, OverDrive, the largest aggregator, processed 70 million digital checkouts of ebooks and audiobooks; by 2020, that number had risen to 430 million. Id. ¶¶ 119, 164.\n\nThe Publishers use several licensing models to profit from the distribution of ebooks to libraries. Id. ¶¶ 120, 122. All four Publishers offer a “one-copy, one-user” model: Libraries pay a single fee for an ebook and patrons check out a copy of that ebook successively, subject to community-based and DRM restrictions. Id. ¶ 127. Each Publisher offers academic libraries a perpetual term under this model, and Wiley grants perpetual one-copy, one-user licenses to academic and public libraries alike. Id. ¶¶ 130-132. Hachette and Penguin limit their one-copy, one-user licenses for public libraries to one- or two-year terms, during which there is no limit on the number of times an ebook can be read and after which a library must purchase a new license. Id. ¶¶ 134, 147. HarperCollins uses a “26-Circ Model,” which allows libraries to circulate an ebook twenty-six times, over any time period, before the license expires. Id. ¶¶ 135-140. HarperCollins and Penguin also use a Pay-Per-Use model -- a onetime circulation to a single patron at a significantly reduced fee -- and Wiley has experimented with various subscription models. Id. ¶¶ 141-146, 155, 191. The Publishers’ library expert testified, and IA does not dispute, that this “thriving ebook licensing market for libraries” has “increased in recent years” and “is predicated on licensing revenues that are paid by libraries to entities like OverDrive.” Id. ¶ 168. For example, library ebook licenses generate around $59 million per year for Penguin. Id. ¶ 170. Between 2015 and 2020, HarperCollins earned $46.91 million from the American library ebook market. Id. ¶ 172.\n\nIA offers readers a different way to read ebooks online for free. Over the past decade, IA has scanned millions of print books and made the resulting ebooks publicly available on its archive.org and openlibrary.org websites (together, the “Website”). Id. ¶¶ 7, 236; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 12. IA’s basic modus operandi is to acquire print books directly or indirectly, digitally scan them, and distribute the digital copies while retaining the print copies in storage. The Open Library of Richmond (the “Open Library”), another non-profit organization run by Brewster Kahle, buys or accepts donations of print books, primarily from Better World Books (“BWB”), a for-profit used bookstore affiliated with IA and the Open Library. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 313-314, 317, 322, 338. The Open Library then sends the books to IA scanning centers, where operators turn and photograph each page using a book-digitization device called a “Scribe.” Id. ¶¶ 281-283. After scanning, the print books are stored in doublestacked shipping containers and are not circulated. Id. ¶¶ 310- 312; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 23.\n\nIA’s Website includes millions of public domain ebooks that users can download for free and read without restrictions. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 158, 160. Relevant to this action, however, the Website also includes 3.6 million books protected by valid copyrights, including 33,000 of the Publishers’ titles and all of the Works in Suit. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 14, 240; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 160. The Publishers did not authorize IA to create digital copies of the Works in Suit or to distribute those unauthorized ebook editions on IA’s Website. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 243.\n\nIA does not make its ebook copies of copyright-protected works available for mass download. Instead, it professes to perform the traditional function of a library by lending only limited numbers of these works at a time through “Controlled Digital Lending,” or “CDL.” Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 11. CDL’s central tenet, according to a September 2018 Statement and White Paper by a group of librarians, is that an entity that owns a physical book can scan that book and “circulate [the] digitized title in place of [the] physical one in a controlled manner.” Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 436. CDL’s most critical component is a one-to-one “owned to loaned ratio.” Id. Thus, a library or organization that practices CDL will seek to “only loan simultaneously the number of copies that it has legitimately acquired.” Id. “For example, if a library owns three copies of a title and digitizes one copy, it may use CDL to circulate one digital copy and two print, or three digital copies, or two digital copies and one print; in all cases, it could only circulate the same number of copies that it owned before digitization.” Id. According to IA, CDL is especially helpful for patrons who live far from a brick-andmortar library, patrons seeking a book not available from their local library, patrons with disabilities that make it difficult to hold or read print books, and patrons who want brief or spontaneous access to books and for whom it would not be worth a trip to a brick-and-mortar library. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 55-56. \n\nUnder IA’s implementation of CDL, two factors determine the number of digital copies of a book that can be borrowed at any time from IA’s Website. Id. ¶ 50. First, IA makes available one digital copy for each non-circulating print book it keeps in storage. Id. ¶ 51. Second, IA partners with libraries to “contribute” the number of their print copies of the book toward the number of lendable copies on IA’s Website. Id. ¶ 52. Even if a partner library has multiple copies of a book, IA counts only one additional copy per library. Id. For example, if IA owns one non-circulating print copy of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie (1932), and three partner libraries each contribute a copy of the book, IA would lend its digital copy of Little House on the Prairie to up to four patrons at a time. Id. ¶ 53.2\n\nAround 2018, IA began expanding significantly its lending capacity of copyright-protected works through the “Open Libraries” project. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 355. Libraries now can “pool[] their physical collections” with IA “in order to make more lendable copies of digital books available to their users and the world.” Id. ¶ 363. To participate, a Partner Library sends its catalogue to IA to run an “overlap analysis” that compares ISBN numbers for the Partner Library’s physical holdings with IA’s digital holdings. Id. ¶ 365. Whenever a book in the Partner Library’s catalogue matches an ebook on IA’s Website, IA increases by one the number of concurrent checkouts of that book allowed on the Website. Id. ¶ 367. As of late 2021, 62 Partner Libraries, including 13 public libraries, had contributed books through IA’s overlap analysis. Id. ¶ 392. IA encourages Partner Libraries to populate their websites with links to IA’s Website. Id. ¶¶ 393-396. \n\nAnyone can become a patron of IA, and borrow up to ten ebooks at a time for up to fourteen days each, by submitting a valid email address. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 25-26. IA never charges patrons fees for any service, including borrowing books. Id. ¶ 25. The Website has titles in popular categories, including Romance, Thrillers, “Books we Love,” and “Trending Books.” Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 514-516. Patrons can read books they have checked out on IA’s BookReader web browser platform, or they can download a “High Quality” encrypted PDF or ePub version of the ebook.3 Id. ¶¶ 207-209, 277; Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 32, 34. IA secures its downloadable versions with software that prevents the patron from copying, accessing, or distributing the book after the loan period. Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 34. The BookReader application also has a “Read Aloud” feature that converts the text to audio and plays it aloud. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 276. After a book is checked out, a “Purchase at Better World Books” button appears at the top of the browser window. Id. ¶ 346. This button links to BWB’s website, where patrons can buy a used print copy of the book. Id. ¶ 347. BWB pays IA whenever someone buys a book after using the “Purchase at Better World Books” link. Id. IA’s Website also includes a link to “Donate” to IA. Id. ¶ 348.\n\nIn March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic closed libraries nationwide and, by IA’s estimation, took 650 million print books out of circulation. Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 70. Judging itself “uniquely positioned to be able to address this problem quickly and efficiently,” on March 24, 2020, IA launched what it called the National Emergency Library (“NEL”), intending it to “run through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.” Id. ¶¶ 72, 74. During the NEL, IA lifted the technical controls enforcing its one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio and allowed up to ten thousand patrons at a time to borrow each ebook on the Website. Pl.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 542-543, 547. IA ended the NEL on June 16, 2020, shortly after this action was filed, and returned to its “traditional controlled digital lending,” which remains in effect. Id. ¶ 571; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 96.\n\nIn the two years after the NEL, IA’s user base increased from 2.6 million to about 6 million. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 248, 250. As of 2022, IA hosts about 70,000 daily ebook “borrows.” Id. ¶ 249."}, {"id": 29920, "actor": "SEO & Content Marketing", "prompt": "I want you to help me write an article about \"CS: hia home owners warranty insurance \" in NSW.

I don't Know where to find my security code etc. Help pls!\nTo establish a wireless connection between the router and computer the router's wireless setting (SSID or Network Name Channel and Mode of communication) has to be configured. Please follow the steps below to configure the wireless settings on your NETGEAR router.\n1. Connect a computer to the LAN port of the router using an ethernet cable.\n3. Type the Username as admin and Password as password. Then click OK.\n4. To change the Wireless settings click Wireless Settings under Setup on the left menu bar.\n-> Select the Region as applicable - Incorrect selection may cause performance problems.\n-> Select any one of the available Channel.\nStep 1: Find a suitable location for the wireless router. Select an elevated central position that's close to a power outlet and offers optimal wireless reception across as much of your home or office as possible. Don't place the router on the floor under a desk or near household appliances and other large metallic objects because these can interfere with the wireless signal and block reception.\nStep 2: Peel off the protective film cover from the sides of the router.\nStep 3: Clip the router into the supplied stand.\nStep 4: Insert the Resource CD into the computer's drive. The program starts automatically. Click the \"Setup\" option in the program window.\nStep 5: Click the \"Yes\" button when the Smart Wizard prompts you to download and install the latest firmware updates for the router.\nStep 6: Follow the onscreen instructions in the Smart Wizard to set up the router. During this process you connect the router to your DSL socket or cable modem and also connect the LAN socket on your computer to a LAN port on the router with the supplied Ethernet cable. You also plug the router's AC adapter into the power outlet and power on the device. The Smart Wizard then guides you through connecting the router to the Internet setting up your wireless network and configuring security protection for the network.\nStep 7: Wait for the Smart Wizard to complete the installation procedure and automatically close the program window. The Smart Wizard adds a \"Router_Setup.html\" file and router login shortcut to your computer's desktop so that you can view the Netgear router's settings.\n1.First of all, you have to connect the ethernet cable to modem and Netgear router. You have to connect one end of the ethernet cable into modem’s WAN port and another end into Netgear router’s yellow port.\n2.Now, take an extra ethernet cable and insert its one end into Netgear router’s first LAN port and another end into your system.\n3.After this, restart Netgear router, modem, and your PC.\n4.Open the internet browser, type “192.168.1.1” in the address bar and press Enter key.\n5.To access Netgear router settings, you need to enter login values with the “username” and “password” field.\n6. Once you logged into Netgear router setup page, move to Setup wizard and detect your internet connection type. Now, your Netgear router will automatically detect your internet connection.\nIf you face any problem at this moment then dial Netgear Router Technical Support Number.\n7. If everything is OK then move to Netgear router security settings. Choose “WPA2-PSK ” as the authentication method.\n8. If Netgear router failed to detect modem then you need to restart all devices. To prevent unauthorized access to Netgear router, turn off the guest network and also lock Netgear router setup page.\n9. At last, save the entire settings. Now your Netgear router will reboot. In case, Netgear router does not reboot automatically when you have to manually perform this.\n1. While setting the password, make sure it is unique and no one can even guess it. Also, note down on a piece of paper.\n2.Reset Netgear router to default settings when required. Because after resetting, all settings will get erased and you have again set them manually.\nI hope, you will get some help from my answer. If still, any problem occurs with Netgear router then directly talk to experts by calling on Netgear Router Technical Support Number.\nIf you formatted it and lost your connection then you have probably lost the driver for the wireless card and the password if u have one for the router, check the model laptop get the driver on usb, install it then connect and if you have any security on router you forgot delete it and set it up again by plugging ur computer in with a wire to the router and typing ur ip in the Address bar of explorer.\nHow to Setup Netgear Router for Cable Internet Connection?\nType 1 and Type 2 Powered Devices for Cisco Catalyst WS-C2960X-48FPD-L Switch?

The syllabus for the upcoming test is lectures 10-15. The content of the 10th lecture is as follows:\n```\nSlide 1:\nLongitudinal Static Stability\nRecall that the eigenvalues of the short period (SP) dynamics are given by\n$$\n\\lambda^2-M\\_q \\lambda-M\\_\\alpha=0\n$$\nHorizontal tail and the wing \"stabilize\" $M\\_q$\nHT \"stabilizes\" $M\\_\\alpha$, but the wing does not necessarily do as much\nToday's class: a closer look at $M\\_\\alpha$\n- Static stability and $M\\_\\alpha$\n- Stability metric: static margin\n- Stick-free and stick-fixed static stability\n\nSlide 2:\nReview of Stability\nSo far: an aircraft is stable if it rejects a disturbance; i.e., the aircraft\nreturns to the intended equilibrium as t goes to 1\nA di↵erent perspective on stability: when the aircraft is disturbed from\nthe equilibrium, do the forces and moments instantaneously try to restore\nthe equilibrium?\nStrictly speaking, the initial response\nType of disturbance: perturbation in the position of the aircraft\nAnalogy motivated by the classic example of a ball and a\ncurved surface\n\nSlide 3:\n- Formal definition: a system is statically stable if, upon a disturbance $\\Delta x$, the force $F$ produced by the system is such that $F \\cdot \\Delta x<0$\n- This is considered to be a necessary condition for stability (in the sense of asymptotic convergence to equilibrium)\nExample (spring-mass system): let $\\ddot{x}=F=-k x$, where $k>0$\n- Clearly, $x \\cdot F=-k x^2<0$. Hence, the system is statically stable\n- Eigenvalues: $\\lambda= \\pm i \\sqrt{k} \\Longrightarrow$ the system is marginally stable\n\nSlide 4:\nExample (spring-mass system): let ̈x = F = 2 ̇x - x, with the initial\n\ncondition x(0) = 0.1, x ̇(0) = 0\nThe initial force F(0) =\n\nx(0), and x(0) · F(x(0)) < 0.\n\nThe system is statically stable\nEigenvalues:\n\n\\lambda = 1 the system is unstable\n\nThus, static stability is not a sufficient condition for stability\nStatic stability is determined only by the stiffness of the system\nWhy bother about static stability?\n-Historical evolution of ideas\n-Design parameters\n\nSlide 5:\nFramework for Longitudinal Static Stability\n\nSet lateral-directional variables to zero\nAssume \\alpha is small\nAnalysis for the wing, followed by wing + HT\n\nSlide 6:\nSingle Wing: Trim\n- Suppose the wing $A C$ is at a distance $x\\_{A C}$ from the CG of the aircraft. We first determine the trim $\\alpha$ by setting $M^0=0$ (about the CG)\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\left(c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}+x\\_{A C}\\left(C\\_{L\\_0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)\\right)=0 \\\\\n\\Longrightarrow \\quad & \\alpha^0=-\\frac{c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}+x\\_{A C} C\\_{L\\_0}}{x\\_{A C} C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nTrimmed value of lift (with $C\\_{m\\_{A C}}<0$ )\n$$\nL^0=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\left(-\\frac{c C\\_{m\\_{A C}}}{x\\_{A C}}\\right) \\begin{cases}>0, & x\\_{A C}>0 \\\\ <0, & x\\_{A C}<0\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSlide 7:\nSuppose the AoA is perturbed by $\\Delta \\alpha$ (small). The instantaneous pitching moment is given by\n$$\n\\Delta M=x\\_{A C} L\\_\\alpha \\Delta \\alpha\n$$\nStatic stability: need $\\Delta \\alpha \\cdot \\Delta M<0$, i.e., $x\\_{A C}<0$\nCondition for static stability of a wing: wing must be behind the CG\nBut we need $x\\_{A C}>0$ for positive lift!\nTwo ways to tackle this problem:\n- Use a flap and active control\n- Use a horizontal tail\n\nSlide 8: Trimming with a Horizontal Tail\nLet $\\alpha^0$ be the trim angle of attack of the aircraft. We will assume that:\nThe wing inclination angle $i\\_w=0$ and the tail is symmetric\nThe tail incidence angle $i\\_t$ can be varied as a control input\nThe effect of downwash is negligible\nThe lift on the tail is given by\n$$\nL\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha+i\\_t\\right)\n$$\nNote: if the tail has an elevator instead of variable $i\\_t$ as the control input, then\n$$\nL\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t\\left(C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha+i\\_t\\right)+C\\_{L\\_{\\delta e}} \\delta\\_e\\right)\n$$\n\nSlide 9:\nAt trim, $M=M^{\\text {wing }}+M^{\\text {tail }}=0$ about the $C G$; i.e.,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& M^{\\text {wing }}+L^{\\text {wing }} x\\_{A C}=I\\_t L^{\\text {tail }} \\\\\n\\text { Thus, } & x\\_{A C}\\left(C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)+c C\\_{m a c}=\\frac{I\\_t S\\_t}{S} C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha^0+i\\_t\\right) \\\\\n\\text { i.e., } \\quad & \\frac{x\\_{A C}}{c}\\left(C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\alpha^0\\right)+C\\_{m a c}=V\\_H C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}\\left(\\alpha^0+i\\_t\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe trim $A \\circ A$ is given by\n$$\n\\alpha^0=\\frac{1}{\\left(V\\_H-x\\_{A C} / c\\right) C\\_{L\\_\\alpha}}\\left(\\left(x\\_{a c} / c\\right) C\\_{L 0}+C\\_{m a c}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{V\\_H}{V\\_H-x\\_{A C} / c}\\right) i\\_t\n$$\nUsually, $V\\_H>x\\_{A C} / c$. Therefore, as $i\\_t$ increases (i.e., deflects downwards), the trim $\\alpha^0$ reduces, and vice-versa.\nTherefore, the tail-based control surface allows the aircraft to trim across a wide range of values of lift (and flight speeds). The same principle applies to elevator-based control.\n\nSlide 10: Static Stability\nSuppose that the angle of attack is perturbed by a small $\\Delta \\alpha$. Then,\nChange in lift on the wing: $\\Delta L^w=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha$\nChange in lift on HT: $\\Delta L^t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S\\_t C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha$\nNet change in pitching moment\n$$\n\\Delta M=\\Delta L^w x\\_{A C}-\\Delta L^t I\\_t=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 S c C\\_{L\\_\\alpha} \\Delta \\alpha\\left(\\frac{x\\_{A C}}{c}-V\\_H\\right)\n$$\nNeed $\\Delta \\alpha \\times \\Delta M<0$ for static stability\nAircraft is longitudinally statically stable only if $V\\_H>\\frac{X\\_{A C}}{c}$\n\nSlide 11: Interpreting the Static Stability Condition\nStatic stability condition: $V\\_H>X\\_{A C} / C$\nThe critical location of the $C G$ at which $c V\\_H=x\\_{A C}$ is called the neutral point (NP)\n- CG ahead of NP: statically stable\n- CG behind NP: statically unstable\nIf the whole aircraft were viewed as a single wing, then the NP corresponds the location of the $A C$ of the complete aircraft\nWe define the static margin:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SM}=\\frac{x\\_{N P}-x\\_{A C}}{c}\n$$\nAn aircraft is loaded on the ground with payload and fuel so that the static margin never decreases below a threshold\n```\n\nNow get started with your tutoring for lecture 10"}, {"id": 29947, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Rank the Spider-Man films according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores.

While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a great picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace.
