The feature will roll out to users globally in the “coming weeks,” the company says. (How it will work at launch is up for debate: some users were reporting being routed to gas stations instead of EV chargers.)\n\nWaze briefly trialed adding EV chargers to its route planning tool back in 2021 in partnership with Volkswagen. But that trial only lasted a few weeks, and after it concluded, the charging stations vanished from the app. With today’s announcement, Waze has added EV charging “permanently” to the app, a company spokesperson said.\n\nWaze also claims that thanks to its crowdsourced map editing function, “EV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.”\n\n“Charging station information is often inconsistent, outdated or unreliable, creating a major pain point for EV drivers who may navigate to a charging station only to discover they can’t find it or use it,” Waze says in a blog post. “By adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it’s even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you’ll come across the next station.”\n\nWaze is not the only navigation app trying to improve the experience of finding a working EV charger. Google, which owns Waze, has been tweaking its own flagship app, Google Maps, including information about the types of plugs present at certain charging stations and whether those plugs are currently in use. The company also recently upgraded EV charging searches for electric vehicles with Google built-in software.\n\nThere is a host of EV charging navigation tools, from A Better Route Planner to PlugShare to Chargeway. All have their upsides and downsides. But with these new updates, Waze may soon rise to the top of the list of preferred services by EV owners.\nWaze route plans will now include electric vehicle charger locations\nEV drivers now have one more option for planning the best route with charging.\n\nElectric vehicle-specific navigation is coming to Waze. The map app is rolling out new data beginning today that now includes EV charger location information, which it will use to help EV drivers plan routes.\n\nThe new app feature will let you specify your EV type and the relevant charging plug, which you can use to filter just the appropriate charging stations. Waze says that its community will review and update the map data \"in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.\"\n\nWaze's addition of EV charger location data now gives EV drivers yet another route-planning tool. Apps like PlugShare and A Better Route Planner are both widely used by EV drivers to find chargers, and both Apple Maps and Google Maps have EV-routing features now as well.\n\nAnd as EV drivers already know, it's common practice for all but the barest-bones EV to feature charger locations in their onboard navigation system. In fact, it can be preferable to use that option rather than casting from one's phone, as many EVs will precondition the battery for faster charging if the native navigation app has a charger set as the destination.\n\nWaze will begin rolling out the EV data from today, although it says it will do so globally \"over the coming weeks.\""}, {"id": 1667, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": ":\nYou are given a code snippet for a Python unit test file that may belong to a larger codebase.

Given material: Is the spotlight fading on Ed Miliband’s leadership? Labour appears to have sleepwalked into a leadership crisis. But how likely are claims of a new leader to replace him before the 2015 general election? And who might replace him? Is Ed Miliband on borrowed time? Can he survive the weekend? Until Christmas? Until next year’s election? In the last 72 hours Labour has been plunged into panic with talk of poisonous briefings and even claims that a letter is circulating calling for Mr Miliband to stand aside. But why now? What exactly is troubling the party that was not doing so six months ago? And is there anything in any of this beyond feverish speculation? Well, yes and no. First, the speculation. As of yet no such “letter” has been seen. No MP has come out on the record in favour of ousting their leader. Nor are any of the recent criticisms of his leadership particularly new. Mr Miliband has long suffered an image problem. There have been flashes of policy inspiration, but he has struggled to broaden his appeal beyond core Labour voters. Some say the cost-of-living-crisis is not permeating with quite the policy punch he would hope. What has changed for Mr Miliband recently is the acuteness of his problems. Consider the above against the more pressing backdrop of a collapse in his personal poll ratings, the rise of the SNP threatening to scorch 20 of Labour’s 41 Scottish seats (crucial for a 2015 victory). Add the Greens garnering greater support – not to mention Ukip broadening its appeal among the working class. Suddenly the picture changes. Problems that were once platitudes now have a crushing urgency to be resolved. Indeed, by this analysis Labour is not just drifting. It is failing to pre-empt contemporary political threats – and, thanks to new, credible alternatives, heading to the humiliation of defeat where victory once seemed likely. That is a particularly rude awakening for MPs, many of whom feel the downward trajectory is difficult to curtail at this late stage. Add that to the New Statesman magazine appearing to withdraw its once-default support for Mr Miliband, and it soon becomes clear why the mood inside Labour HQ has plummeted. But could this really result in a change of leader before the election? The prospect is not impossible but it is still difficult to imagine. Firstly, Labour’s historical record in ousting a leader is nothing short of abysmal. Party rules mean that a vote of no-confidence can only be marshalled during the party’s annual conference – which was six weeks ago. For the moment, curmudgeonly backbenchers seem happier complaining off-the-record about their leader than putting their head above the parapet and pitching an alternative. And that’s hardly surprising. Labour’s MP’s are not known to be forward about coming forward. One only need remember 2009 during Gordon Brown’s premiership which saw former pensions secretary James Purnell’s dramatic resignation, in which he called for the then prime minister to stand aside “to give Labour a fighting chance of winning the next election”. It was followed in 2010 by simultaneous resignations by Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon. But neither of these were enough to move Mr Brown, who went on to lose the election himself five months later. Mr Miliband appears just as resilient. The prospect of him grabbing his coat and exiting stage left is unlikely. Three MPs are understood to have told Dave Watts, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party that Mr Miliband should stand down. But it will need far more than that – as well as a clear contingency plan – for any chance of a leadership shift. Finally, the perennial question that hampers any immediate prospect of change. Who exactly would replace him? Who could actually do a better job? And who could stave off the prospect of a party implosion that would almost inevitably follow? With no clear contender to challenge Mr Miliband, talk of a change of leader remains just that. Here are five potential successors. The shadow health secretary is currently the leading candidate. His performances at the last Labour conference were impressive, where Mr Miliband’s were not. His dogged campaigning on the Hillsborough tragedy has won admiration across parliament. His working class roots are of contrast to Mr Miliband who the New Statesman described as an “old-style Hampstead socialist”. One of the more accomplished performers, who has been impressive head-to-head against Home Secretary Theresa May. The shadow home secretary would have the support of her husband, Ed Balls. But that could also be to her detriment. Many believe Balls is too closely linked to the Brown and Miliband era. He is already tipped as a future Labour leader but an elevation to the top post may seem premature for the 36-year-old. Instead the shadow business secretary called on the party to focus on “communities, rather than the distracting nonsense by some in the Westminster bubble”. The shadow welfare secretary has had a meteoric rise entering the shadow cabinet 18 months after election despite being described by the editor of BBC Newsnight as “boring snoring”. A former UK junior chess champion and Bank of England economist is among a number of Labour MPs who have been tipped for leadership positions but whose time may not be yet. She wrote on Twitter: “A Labour government will make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people. But we’ll only get one if we stay united behind Ed Miliband”. The former postman who served as home secretary under Gordon Brown, appears to value his private life and has all but ruled himself out last month when he said he had “no appetite for being on the frontbench” let alone a potential prime minister which he described as a “god-awful job”."}, {"id": 1671, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are tasked with implementing a control mechanism for a pitch angle.

There is no one like him on the earth. He is an upright man of integrity, fearing God and shunning what is bad.” At that Satan answered Jehovah: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have you not put up a protective hedge around himm and his house and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands,n and his livestock has spread out in the land. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” Then Jehovah said to Satan: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only do not lay your hand on the man himself!” So Satan went out from the presence\\* of Jehovah.\nNow on the day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,p 14 a messenger came to Job and said: “The cattle were plowing and the donkeys were grazing beside them 15 when the Sa·beʹans attacked and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n16 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “Fire from God\\* fell from the heavens and blazed among the sheep and the servants and consumed them! I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n17 While he was still speaking, another one came and said: “The Chal·deʹansq formed three bands and made a raid on the camels and took them, and they killed the servants with the sword. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n18 While he was still speaking, yet another one came and said: “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house. 19 Suddenly a great wind came from the wilderness, and it struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell on the young people and they were killed. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”\n20 At that Job got up and ripped apart his garment and cut the hair off his head; then he fell to the ground and bowed down 21 and said:\n“Naked I came out of my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked I will return.r\nJehovah has given,s and Jehovah has taken away.\nLet the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.”\n22 In all of this, Job did not sin or accuse God of doing anything wrong.\\*"}, {"id": 1695, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "write me a deployment for iRedMail container, for kurbernetes wth 2 nodes , with high availability , scaling, best security , Volume claim to save the data, everything needed as best practices"}, {"id": 1696, "actor": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "prompt": "*Ans* no\n*Question* Does the following sentence make sense?\n\"Jurisprudence turns judges into greedy men.\"\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n*CoT* Jurisprudence is a code for equitable and just legal conduct.\n\n\n*Ans* no\n*Question* Is the following sentence factually correct?\n\"An American Jew who tells prophecies is known as a John the Baptist.\"\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n*CoT* John the Baptist a prophet of Islam who has no connection to American Jews.\n\n\n*Ans* yes\n*Question*"}, {"id": 1697, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are working on a text-based RPG game and need to implement a combat system.
