The technique involves blowing a very fine wind over the surface of the crystal at various angles to detect boundaries (indicated by molecules that are exposed to the wind). This is repeated with different wind directions and the boundaries observed for each direction are recorded. Your team has already collected the data, but – as is often the case with applied science – now the real work, analysis, must begin.\n\nFor a given crystal, you will receive the directions in which wind blew over the surface, and the locations of all boundaries encountered by each of these winds. For a wind blowing in direction (wx, wy), a boundary is defined as a location (x, y) such that a molecule exists at (x, y) and no molecule exists at (x − wx, y − wy). Note that for technical reasons wx and wy are not necessarily relatively prime.\n\nThe data might not uniquely determine the structure of the crystal. You must find the two unique structures with the minimal and maximal number of molecules consistent with the observations.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, nine different molecules are directly encountered by the given winds. There must be a molecule at location (3, 3) because otherwise (4, 2) would be a boundary for the third wind. For similar reasons, there must be molecules at (4, 4) and (5, 5). There cannot be any further molecules as they would result in additional observations for some of the winds.\n\ninput\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers dx, dy, and k, where dx and dy (1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ 103) are the maximum dimensions of the crystal structure, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10) is the number of times wind was blown over the crystal.\n\nEach of the remaining k lines specifies the data for one wind. These lines each start with two integers wx and wy (-dx ≤ wx ≤ dx and -dy ≤ wy ≤ dy, but not both zero) denoting the direction of the wind. Then comes an integer b (0 ≤ b ≤ 105) giving the number of boundaries encountered by this wind. The line finishes with b distinct pairs of integers x, y (1 ≤ x ≤ dx and 1 ≤ y ≤ dy) listing each observed boundary.\n\nYou may assume the input is consistent with at least one crystal and that no molecules exist outside the specified dimensions.\n\noutput\n\nOutput two textual representations of the crystal structure separated by an empty line. Each structure has dy rows of dx characters, with the top-left corner corresponding to location (1, 1).

Your task is to understand the code snippet and write a detailed explanation of what each function does and how they can be used.\n\n1. `_assert_on_projects`:\nThe `_assert_on_projects` function takes three arguments: `student_teams`, `master_repo_names`, and `assertion`. It appears to be a helper function used to assert certain conditions on a list of projects. Let's understand the function step by step:\n- First, the function loops over a list of `student_teams`. Each `student_team` object is expected to have a `title` attribute.\n- Inside the loop, there is another loop that iterates over a list of `master_repo_names`.\n- In each iteration of the inner loop, the function checks if the `title` of the `student_team` matches the `master_repo_name`.\n- If there is a match, the function executes a series of assertions:\n  * It asserts that the `title` of the `actual_issue` (an object) is equal to the `title` of the `expected_issue` (another object).\n  * It asserts that the `state` of the `actual_issue` is equal to `expected_state`.\n  * It asserts that the `description` of the `actual_issue` is equal to the `body` of the `expected_issue`.\n  * It asserts that the number of `assignees` in the `actual_issue` is equal to `expected_num_assignees`.\n  * It asserts that `ACTUAL_USER` (presumably a constant) is not in the list of usernames of any `assignee` in the `actual_issue`.\n- If all these assertions pass, the function returns.\n- If no issue matching the specified title is found in the loop, the function raises an `AssertionError` with the message \"no issue matching the specified title\".\n\n2. `assert_num_issues`:\nThe `assert_num_issues` function takes three arguments: `student_teams`, `master_repo_names`, and `num_issues`. It appears to be another helper function used to assert the number of issues in a list of projects. Let's analyze the function:\n- The function calls `_assert_on_projects` with the same arguments.\n- After the function call, it compares the length of `actual_issues` (which is not explicitly defined in the code snippet) with the provided `num_issues`.\n- If the lengths match, the function returns.\n- If the lengths don't match, the function raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nYour task is to understand the code snippet thoroughly and describe the functionality of the two functions in detail, explaining their argument types, return values, and potential use cases.

You have been given a code snippet that implements the binomial model, but it has some issues. Your task is to fix the code and improve its efficiency.\n\nThe code snippet calculates the value of an option by iterating over each step of a binomial tree. The variable `optionmodel` represents the option values at different steps of the tree.\n\nThe binomial model calculations should be done from the last step to the first step. Within each step, the option value is determined by considering two possibilities: exercising the option (represented by `strikeprice - binomialmodel[i,j]`) or not exercising the option. The latter is calculated using the probability of the option price going up (`p`) and the probability of it going down (`invp`). The option value at the current step is then discounted by the risk-free interest rate (`IR * deltaT`) using the exponential function (`math.exp()`).\n\nHowever, the current code has a couple of issues:\n1. The iteration for calculating `optionmodel` starts from `i = roundedint - m - 1`, but it should start from `i = roundedint - m`.\n2. The line `optionmodel[i,j] = max(optionmodel[i,j] ,strikeprice -  binomialmodel[i,j])` should be executed before the line `optionmodel[i,j] = (p * optionmodel[i+1 , j ] + invp * optionmodel[i + 1,j+1 ]) * math.exp(-IR * deltaT)`.\n3. There is an error in the `print` statement just before the `main` function call. The `element` variable is not defined.\n\nYour task is to fix the mentioned issues in the code snippet. Additionally, you should optimize the code to reduce redundant calculations and inefficient memory allocation. \n\nWrite a function `calculate_option_value(roundedint: int, m: int, p: float, invp: float, IR: float, deltaT: float, strikeprice: float, binomialmodel: List[List[float]]) -> float` that takes the following parameters:\n\n- `roundedint` (integer): The number of steps in the binomial tree (rounded to the nearest integer).\n- `m` (integer): The current step in the binomial tree.\n- `p` (float): The probability of the option price going up.\n- `invp` (float): The probability of the option price going down.\n- `IR` (float): The risk-free interest rate.\n- `deltaT` (float): The time period between steps in the binomial tree.\n- `strikeprice` (float): The strike price of the option.\n- `binomialmodel` (list of lists of floats): The binomial model representing the option values at different steps of the tree.\n\nThe function should compute and return the value of the option at step `m` using the corrected binomial model calculations.\n\nAssume that all input values are within valid ranges and the `binomialmodel` list is properly initialized.\n\n**Note:**\n- You should fix the code based on the given issues and optimize it for efficiency.\n- Your solution should not make any assumptions about the values of `roundedint`, `m`, `p`, `invp`, `IR`, `deltaT`, `strikeprice`, or `binomialmodel`.
