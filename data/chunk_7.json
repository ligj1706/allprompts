For example, the GCF of 8 and 12 is 4.\n\nThe greatest common factor can be computed using the following rules.\n\nCase I: If a is evenly divisible by b, then the GCF is b.\nCase II: If a is not evenly divisible by b, then the GCF of a and b is equal to the GCF of b and the remainder when a is divided by b.\nIf the rule in case II is repeatedly applied, it is guaranteed to eventually result in case I. Consider the following examples.\n\nExample 1\nIn determining the GCF of 30 and 3, case I applies because 30 is evenly divisible by 3. Therefore, the GCF of 30 and 3 is 3.\nExample 2\nIn determining the GCF of 3 and 30, case II applies because 3 is not evenly divisible by 30. The GCF of 3 and 30 will be equal to the GCF of 30 and the remainder when 3 is divided by 30, or 3.\nIn determining the GCF of 30 and 3, case I applies because 30 is evenly divisible by 3. The GCF of 30 and 3 is 3, and therefore the GCF of 3 and 30 is also 3.\nExample 3\nIn determining the GCF of 24 and 9, case II applies because 24 is not evenly divisible by 9. The GCF of 24 and 9 will be equal to the GCF of 9 and the remainder when 24 is divided by 9, or 6.\nIn determining the GCF of 9 and 6, case II applies because 9 is not evenly divisible by 6. The GCF of 9 and 6 will be equal to the GCF of 6 and the remainder when 9 is divided by 6, or 3.\nIn determining the GCF of 6 and 3, case I applies because 6 is evenly divisible by 3. The GCF of 6 and 3 is 3, and therefore the GCF of 24 and 9 is also 3.\nExample 4\nIn determining the GCF of 7 and 3, case II applies because 7 is not evenly divisible by 3. The GCF of 7 and 3 will be equal to the GCF of 3 and the remainder when 7 is divided by 3, or 1.\nIn determining the GCF of 3 and 1, case I applies because 3 is evenly divisible by 1.

Drill life optimisation when drilling TI-6AL-4V with HSS drills. ICME 9th International Conference on Manufacturing Excellence 2003 (pp. 1-12). Australia: Instiution of Engineers.\nRelatively low machinability of titanium and its alloys is caused mainly by their poor thermal conductivity, low modulus of elasticity, chemical reactivity with cutting tool materials at high temperatures and work bardening characteristics that produce high chip loads near the tool cutting edge of the tools. However, the widespread use of titanium and its alloys for critical components in many applications, bas attracted significant attention for investigations on machinability resulting in a number of recommendations.\nIn many instances, particularly for small production runs of deep-hole drilling in titanium alloy components, drilling operations are carried out by using HSS drills. Not much literature is available concerning this aspect of driIIing. This paper presents an investigation wherein cutting forces, acoustic emissions and chip formation were examined during deep-hole drilling of Ti-6M-4V at various cutting speeds and reed rates and optimum drilling parameters were detennined. Then a CNC program that incorporated the optimum cutting speed and feed parameters, along with a series of chip brealer and full relief steps, was developed. The CNC program was observed to provide a trouble-free deep drilling operation on Ti-6M-4V bars with high-speed steel drills.
