If convicted, he could face 10 years in prison. The 26-year-old former police officer from Madison, Alabama also faces a misdemeanor assault charge in Limestone County, which could put him in jail for up to a year.\nParker is currently free on a $5000 bond, and will face trial on June 1. A civil case against him by the family of the injured man has been put on hold until the criminal proceedings are resolved.\nMadison police released recordings of a call reporting a “skinny black guy” with a knit cap walking around an affluent neighborhood and peering into garages, on February 6 in the morning. Parker and two other officers approached the man, later identified as Sureshbhai Patel, 57.\nAn Indian national who came to Alabama to help his son and daughter-in-law with their firstborn, Patel only spoke Gujarati, and tried to tell the officers he was minding his own business.\n“No English. Indian. Walking,” he said, according to his son Chirag’s statement to the local media at the time. Dashboard camera footage released by the police shows Parker slamming Patel on the ground.\nSuffering a neck injury from the impact, Patel was unable to move on his own and was taken to the hospital. Doctors said that without the emergency surgery he would have been permanently paralyzed, Chirag Patel later told AL.com.\nSureshbhai Patel had no health insurance, but a GoFundMe.com campaign established to pay for his medical expenses has raised nearly $210,000. His recovery has been slow and painful, the family says.\nMadison is a town of about 46,000 people in northern Alabama, 10 miles west of Huntsville, and is known for high-tech, aerospace and defense industry.

The edge used to be a place where these devices connected so they could deliver data to, and receive instructions and download software updates from a centrally located data center or the cloud. Now with the explosion of the Internet of Things, that model has shortcomings. IoT devices gather so much data that the sheer volume requires larger and more expensive connections to data centers and the cloud. The nature of the work performed by these IoT devices is also creating a need for much faster connections between the data center or cloud and the devices. For example, if sensors in valves at a petroleum refinery detect dangerously high pressure in the pipes, shutoffs need to be triggered as soon as possible. With analysis of that pressure data taking place at distant processing centers, the automatic shutoff instructions may come too late. But with processing power placed local to the end devices, latency is less, and that roundtrip time can be significantly reduced, potentially saving downtime, damage to property and even lives. Even with the introduction of edge devices that provide local computing and storage, there will still be a need to connect them to data centers, whether they are on premises or in the cloud. For example, temperature and humidity sensors in agricultural fields gather valuable data, but that data doesn’t have to be analyzed or stored in real time. Edge devices can collect, sort and perform preliminary analysis of the data, then send it along to where it needs to go: to centralized applications or some form of long-term storage, again either on-prem or in the cloud. Because this traffic may not be time-sensitive, slower, less expensive connections – possibly over the internet – can be used. And because the data is presorted, the volume of traffic that needs to be sent at all may be reduced. So the upside of edge computing is faster response time for applications that require it and slowing the growth of expensive long-haul connections to processing and storage centers. The downside can be security. With data being collected and analyzed at the edge, it’s important to include security for the IoT devices that connect to the edge devices and for the edge devices themselves. They contains valuable data, but they are also network elements that, if exploited, could compromise other devices that contain stores of valuable assets. With edge computing becoming more essential, it’s also important to make sure that the edge devices themselves don’t become a single point of failure. Network architects need to build in redundancy and provide failover contingencies in order to avoid crippling downtime if a primary node goes down. The industry has already gone a long way toward addressing the demands of edge computing, and it is becoming mainstream. Its importance is likely to grow even more as the use of real-time applications becomes more prevalent.\""}, {"id": 8235, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "What are the traditional songs sung during the Carnevale di Venezia in Italy?"}, {"id": 8236, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "write sample airflow code to load data from salesforce and store it in S3 in .parquet format"}, {"id": 8237, "actor": "SEO & Content Marketing", "prompt": "Chiffrement de Vigenere\n\nPlease write in English language.Share Prompt"}, {"id": 8238, "actor": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "prompt": "How do I write a SQL query to get a list of users on everyday by their active status over last 28 days?"}, {"id": 8239, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "As a detective, you are investigating a case of theft.
