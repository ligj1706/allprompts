They are appointed by the VCH's central editorial office in the Institute of Historical Research or locally with the approval of the University of London, as owners of the VCH project. They are clearly acknowledged in all types of VCH publication. Volunteers work closely with professional or experienced historians and have their contributions approved by them.\nWork is ready for publication when it has been reviewed and edited as part of an iterative process. Publication takes the form of a book (a VCH history as a red book, or a VCH Short). Final submissions for publication, for either series, are edited by the county editors and then by the VCH staff in the central office, who look for quality of content, readability, house style and length.\nReview of work in progress and completed is one of the most important ways of ensuring quality and consistency throughout the VCH.In the counties, draft histories are reviewed as work progresses by local panels formed of professional historians and informed users. Draft histories are uploaded to the county areas of the VCH website so that a wider public has the opportunity to read and review them in advance of publication.Each year, county editors and contributors meet central office staff to review the histories they have written during the previous year, and to discuss plans for completion of work in hand and the county series as a whole. Targets, which are related to the scheduling of each publication, are agreed and county staff report on these quarterly. County editors and contributors are able to help each other by circulating draft parish histories amongst themselves. Such sharing of expertise, which is helpful as the task of covering the long time-spans and range of subjects included in the VCH is a challenge. Internal review also promotes best practice in research and writing across the series. Where thought helpful VCH Central Office might suggest a particular parish history should be read by a particular editor or contributor, but all resulting comments are advisory only.\nIndependent, external peer reviewers are selected when a manuscript has been completed. The reviewer reads and comments on the submission, and advises the county editor and central editorial team on its suitability for publication. Reviewers are chosen by the Editorial Board of the VCH.

She went to a hospital and received treatment for injuries to her head and hand. She later discovered her cat was missing from her car.\nBrooks, who works as an assistant professor of sociology at Troy University Dothan with a specialization in race relations, said she saw a collaboration of different races of people stop on the side of the highway to offer her help.\n\"Losing my cat restored my faith in humanity,\" Brooks said. \"I looked like the `Walking Dead' because my head was bleeding a lot. People were praying over me, and telling me they loved me. I looked up at one point there was like a sea of black and white faces looking over me.\"\nBrooks said she hopes what she called the embarrassing decision to let her cat out of the carrier will help others learn about the dangers of distracted driving.\n\"I'm 50 years old and this is the first serious accident I've ever been in,\" she said. \"I wasn't drunk, and I wasn't texting, but I still made a choice that potentially could've cost other people their lives. I could've caused a multiple car pile-up.\"\nTwo women, who Brooks referred to as her cat angels, found her cat after they set up traps in some woods off Interstate 85 near Newnan, Georgia, in Coweta County.\nBrooks said she wouldn't have been reunited with Tom without the help of Lovy Myers and Elizabeth Perdue. She found Myers and Perdue by searching through a Lost and Found Pets Facebook page.\nBrooks went back to the area of the accident two to three times after the crash, searching for Tom with friends and family.\n\"I posted a picture of Tom and told my story,\" Brooks recalled.\nBrooks said Myers and Perdue both encouraged her from the beginning of the search with hope of finding Tom.\nThrough the search for her cat Brooks learned a lot about the strategy used to search for and locate lost animals, particularly cats.\n\"Lovy had me touching small bushes near the crash and everything,\" Brooks recalled. \"I just realized all the science that goes into all of this. I just didn't know anything about cat behavior.\"\nBrooks said Myers checked out the homes and farms in the area of where accident happened and inquiring on whether they had cats on the property. Brooks learned Myers could then rule out those areas because Tom wouldn't likely venture into the territory of other cats.\n\"She said `in my experience your cat is hiding,\"' Brooks said. \"He is hiding in the woods.\"\nThe accident happened on I-85 right next to some property where a woman who owns and runs an Arabian horse farm. Brooks returned a couple of times after the accident to some woods on the farm's property where she met Myers and Perdue and they set up at least three cat traps.\n\"She's like `usually cats will not venture far away from where they're lost, \"' Brooks said of Myers. \"She's like a pet detective.\"\nBrooks recalled how Myers suggested she bring up Tom's litter box, his cat carrier and even some of her laundry to the woods near the accident to help in the search. She said Myers also set up a camera in the woods, or what she referred to as some \"wildlife cams,\" in an effort to catch Tom on video in the woods.\nBrooks said once a certain area of the woods had been narrowed down Myers set up what she referred to as a \"kitty buffet\" in the woods, which included several different fish foods like tuna placed on top of a piece of cardboard. The \"kitty buffet\" was set up last weekend and Tom was captured on camera.\n\"She actually had him on camera feeding right there in between an opossum and all that,\" Brooks said.\nAfter capturing who she believed was Tom on camera, Myers set the traps up again the very next day, last Sunday. Brooks recalled immediately recognizing Tom upon receiving a text message picture of the captured cat Sunday night. Tom was found about 100 feet off the highway behind a barbed wire fence.\nLast Monday, Brooks brought Tom back home to Dothan.\nBrooks said Myers and Perdue probably spent between 30 and 40 hours helping search for Tom.\n\"They're rescuers,\" she said. \"Just totally selfless. They didn't know me from Adam.\"\nBrooks said Tom probably returned home healthier because he'd lost some weight. She also took him to his veterinarian for a check-up where he received a clean bill of health.\nThe whole process of losing and finding Tom has given Brooks the desire to help out with animal rescue in the Wiregrass.\n\"To have that support, and know people care really means so much. I really just feel a strong need right now to pay back,\" Brooks said. \"It really takes a village.\""}, {"id": 4598, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "In this conversation, I want you to be my tutor for a system administration course.

Lazy days, where sipping on steamy mugs of coffee, while having great conversations is the most relaxing time for me. Enjoying a full brunch, complete with eggs, scones, fruit and more is often on the menu as well.\nHaving new and exciting flavors in our scones is a must to keep things intriguing, too. One morning, I got to watering my rosemary plant and thought, “this would be awesome to use in a scone.” What flavor would balance it out, though? It had to be citrusy and able to take on rosemary’s deep flavor. What did I normally pair rosemary with? Lemon, of course.\nRosemary lemon scones soon became a family favorite.\nI love light and flaky scones, and these did not disappoint. Bright lemon flavor, paired with the deep scent of rosemary is a sure fire winner! The Frenchman actually had a second one, and he never has seconds. Well, not normally, anyway.\nRosemary lemon scones are also fancy enough for a gathering, baby shower, or ladies brunch. Simple enough for a weekday breakfast, making them a true hero.\nIn a medium mixing bowl, add first 5 ingredients. Whisk to combine well.\nCut in very cold butter until mixture is crumbly.\nIn a separate bowl, add in yogurt, egg, 3 Tablespoons of lemon juice and rosemary. Whisk to combine.\nCombine wet ingredients with dry and mix until just combined.\nTurn out onto a floured parchment paper and shape into an 8 inch circle.\nPlace parchment paper on a baking sheet, and cut the dough into 8 triangles, but do not separate.\nSeparate the triangles, and return to the oven for an additional 5-10 minutes until baked through and golden brown.\nMeanwhile, in a small bowl, combine powdered sugar, heavy whipping cream and remaining lemon juice. Whisk to combine thoroughly until smooth.\nDrizzle over warm scones. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for later.\nWhat is your favorite scone recipe?
