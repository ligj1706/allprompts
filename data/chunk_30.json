Each row is comma-separated, with the first row being the header row and the following rows containing data.\n\nThe `start_row` parameter specifies the row number from which the parsing should start. For example, if `start_row` is 2, the parsing should start from the second row (index 1) of the `lines` list.\n\nThe `title_row` parameter specifies the row number that contains the titles (header) of the columns. For example, if `title_row` is 0, the first row (index 0) of the `lines` list contains the titles.\n\nThe `parse` method should return a dictionary that maps each title to a list of corresponding data for that title. The data should be retrieved from the rows below the title row.\n\nFor example, consider the following CSV data:\n\n```\nID,Name,Age\n1,John,25\n2,Emily,30\n3,Michael,35\n```\n\nIf you call the `parse` method with the `lines` parameter set to `[\"ID,Name,Age\", \"1,John,25\", \"2,Emily,30\", \"3,Michael,35\"]`, the method should return the following dictionary:\n\n```\n{\n    \"ID\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"],\n    \"Name\": [\"John\", \"Emily\", \"Michael\"],\n    \"Age\": [\"25\", \"30\", \"35\"]\n}\n```\n\nNote that the dictionary maps each title to a list of corresponding data extracted from the rows below the title row.\n\nImplement the `parse` method of the `CSVParser` class to solve the problem.

I even think it has more appeal than the Xiaomi 12S Ultra and 13 Pro.\n\nIf you’re willing to listen to why I like the Xiaomi 13 so much, then I’d be happy to tell you what’s so great about it.\nDESIGN\nNow phones have been put in more and more stuff, the body has to be bigger and bigger. The largest regular phone has reached 7-inches, if you count the foldable phone then the number will be even like 8 inches. I often miss the old days when the phone could be controlled with one hand. When the mobile phone becomes no longer mobile, then more features also become meaningless. It’s embarrassing to think that it’s difficult to find a small-sized phone these days. It’s especially hard when you’re also trying to find a flagship small phone that doesn’t have shortcomings. I’ve put together the numbers of a few compact phones that look good right now, and blue one is their cons. It’s easy to see that the Xiaomi 13 really has no shortcomings. It’s a bigger phone than the other phones, even a little bigger than the Xiaomi 12. But it perfectly balances size and functionality. That’s the main reason why I like the Xiaomi 13: phones that are better than it, aren’t as small as it. Phones that are smaller than it, not as well as it.\nWhy would I choose white over blue vegan leather. Look at my Xiaomi 12S Ultra that I’ve been using for less than six months. Maybe the footage isn’t visible enough. The leather texture in the four corners has been smoothed out. If you don’t want your phone to look like this, then get the glass version. Because of the small size and light weight, fingerprints are more downward, but does not affect the feel much when holding it.\n\nIn the unboxing video for the Xiaomi 13 series, some viewers guessed that it was still USB 2.0. Congratulations, you guessed right. This is the nightmare for Xiaomi users the whole life.\nLike you guys, I think the Xiaomi 13 must have referenced the iPhone and Samsung. You can say the Xiaomi is copycat, but I don’t think it’s ugly, I even think it’s kind of pretty. Especially the screen. When you light up the screen, you can feel the beauty of it without me saying anything more. The screen, which is almost equal in width on all four sides, puts me in a happy mood every time I use the phone. If there is no front camera, I think it is the best looking screen in the world.\n\nSome people will ask: why don’t you buy Samsung S22? Haha, see Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, do you think I still want to buy it? In addition to the excellent bezel width, other specs are also very powerful. This Samsung E6 panel ensures high brightness while DC dimming is not missing. Adaptive colors, or “True Tone” on the iPhone, are also available. Some people complain that the standard version doesn’t have 2K resolution, but the Xiaomi 13 the display DPI is actually 414, which is sharper than most FHD+ phones. Using 2K resolution on a small phone can also bring down battery life, so the display is really good for just the right amount of time.\n\nPERFORMANCE & GAMING\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2, LPDDR5X and UFS 4.0, the latest chips are of course there. The throttling test also shows that it can keep the performance stable for a long time, so it seems that the 8 Gen 2 has really improved a lot.\nSmaller phones are usually not very good at gaming because of their size limits. But the Xiaomi 13 is an exception. Maybe it’s the new 8 Gen 2 that’s so great, or maybe the cooling system is so nice. Anyway, it does well in Genshin Impact, running around Sumeru can’t stress it out anymore. There were lags during the game, all caused by loading textures. To test how long it takes for Xiaomi 13 to overheat, I followed it up with 25 minutes on Spiral Abyss floor 12, and it still held up. Oh, and the frame drops in the middle were caused by loading, not lagging. The temperature after 45 minutes of intense gaming is also only 45°C.\n\nAll in all, it has no problem handling games. But I still don’t recommend it for long term gaming, because the screen is really small. If you have big hands, it will be more difficult to play.\n\nCompared to the Pro version, the standard version seems to have a less surprising camera system. It does have an average camera performance, but because of this 75mm telephoto lens, it stands out from the crowd of small sized phones. The reason I used to have to use big and heavy flagship phones is that I love telephoto lenses. And most of my photography is taken with telephoto. Now that the Xiaomi 13 also has a 3.2x telephoto and is equipped with OIS, then I can use it with no worries. But don’t get me wrong, I mean an extra telephoto will allow you to compose more angles compared to other compact phones. But the image quality is definitely not as good as flagship phones.\n\nWhen the light is bad, as long as you zoom in on the picture, there is very little detail and all are sharpening traces. Just like the S22, it really can’t put a bigger sensor. So let’s give it a pass.\n\nCAMERA\n\nCompared to the Xiaomi 12S, the 13’s main camera is a step backwards. Although the sensor is smaller, the performance is not much of a step back. Most of the performance is okay, both day and night. I only have two complaints, one is the purple-fringing issue, which is not very well controlled. Another is that the color is a bit strange. Even though we were using the Leica Vibrant mode, the colors were always very dull. The too-intense colors look even worse in the samples taken on cloudy days. These two problems are even worse on the ultra-wide camera. So I’m actually not satisfied with the ultra-wide camera.\n\nBut then again, if I am given two options, a telephoto plus a good main camera, or a very good main camera plus a macro lens, I would definitely choose the former. Users of smaller phones must know what they need, because most of the time they are not able to have both.\n\nYou should not expect anything from the Xiaomi phone front camera. Except for the Civi series, they all perform pretty much the same. Although the photos look good and rich in detail. But the video performance is really not good. Not only is the 4k resolution missing, but it doesn’t even support 60fps. If you pay more attention to the recording of the front camera, then we recommend you to buy other phones.\n\nAll three lenses support different recording specs. The main camera supports up to 8k 24fps and OIS+EIS. the footage also looks the best, stable and clear. The ultra-wide camera supports up to 4k 30fps, which is also good. But the picture does not look so clear. The telephoto camera supports up to 1080P 60fps. only in 1080P 30fps can switch the lens during recording.\n\nBATTERY & CHARGING\n\n67w fast charging and 4500mAh battery, does it sound familiar? Yes, this classic combination is once again found in the Xiaomi 13. I have no complaints about the charging power, 67w is also fast and there is also 50w wireless charging. Plugged in and fully charged in just 41 minutes.\n\n4500mAh is big for a phone of this size, and in actual use it feels about the same as my 12S Ultra, which lasts 5 to 6 hours. Because of the new processor being more power efficient and the smaller screen, it already lasts about the same amount of time as many 6.8 inch phones. One less factor to stop you from buying a smaller phone, isn’t it?\nAfter a few days of use, MIUI 14 has no lags or bugs. Their claim of improving the smoothness of the new system seems to be working so far. No matter how fast your operation is, it doesn’t lag. I don’t know if older Xiaomi phones will be smoother with the MIUI 14 upgrade, but at least with my Xiaomi 13, MIUI 14 is definitely smooth enough.\n\nThere are relatively few new features in 14, one of which is the new icon customization feature. Some icons can change shape, but some can’t. The new folders also open the applications inside of it from the outside. Obviously, MIUI 14 also borrows some features from other systems. But it doesn’t matter to consumers, as long as it works, it’s fine. The biggest upgrade of MIUI 14 should still be this: you can delete most of the system applications. Those apps that you never use can finally be uninstalled. Even the album, weather, can be uninstalled. You can keep only 8 apps, it’s very crazy for MIUI.\nWhen Xiaomi 13 was released, I was very happy because Xiaomi almost created my dream phone. It fits my hand perfectly and didn’t lose important features. Especially the screen, until the S23 was released, I thought the Xiaomi 13 was the best small size flagship in Android. I will also keep my SIM card in this phone all the time, waiting for the next phone to come along that will fascinate me so much.\n\nTAGSXiaomiXiaomi 13Xiaomi 13 Pro"}, {"id": 30306, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Given the given description, classify it as either a historical figure, a myth, or a literary character.\nSherlock Holmes"}, {"id": 30307, "actor": "Job Application & Customer Management", "prompt": "Write a professional and courteous thank-you email addressed to the specific supplier with whom you interacted, expressing gratitude for the outstanding level of customer service experience provided to you.

It is a condition that adversely affects an individual's functional abilities and level of independence by causing chronic impairment and is particularly prevalent in adults and the elderly. Based on Foo (as cited in the Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2010), the prevalence of KOA in Malaysia is estimated to be between 10% to 20% of the elderly population. The growing number of old or natural ageing, and higher body mass index (BMI), are the key factors contributing to KOA, as claimed by Wallace et al. (2017) However, it is common for adults and the elderly to develop knee discomfort or KOA as the cartilage that was supposed to act as a shock absorber for mechanical body weight-bearing movements gradually deteriorates. As a result, KOA can cause chronic progressive pain and disturb the patient’s functional ability. The loss of workforce and other psychological implications can affect a patient's professional life, entertainment, social life, and sleep pattern and significantly reduce the quality of life (QoL) of KOA patients (Askin et al., 2017). This study’s primary concern is to examine the use of manual therapy and exercise therapy in managing the symptoms of KOA, with the primary goal of improving functional ability. Typically, patients with KOA opt for medicine to alleviate pain, oblivious that an active lifestyle is equally required to manage the symptoms of KOA. Pharmaceutical therapies alone will not help patients with KOA improve their functional ability. Therefore, pharmacological therapies should be omitted in this systematic review study. This systematic review study will include all publications and journals describing the effects of manual treatment and exercise therapy on improving the functional ability of KOA patients. This study will then systematically review the medical literature that studied the critical role of manual therapy and exercise therapy as interventions to enhance functional ability and improve QoL. It is necessary to continue this study as the elderly population has a higher risk of developing KOA which cannot be avoided in the natural ageing process that will happen to everyone. Furthermore, Shamsi et al. (2021) studied that age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis will be significantly accelerated in emerging countries and will remain increase in the future, particularly in Asian countries.\n\n1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nThe world-increasing trend of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total knee replacement, as claimed by Gao et al. (2020), is worrying. In the future, it is possible as KOA can be popular among adults as early as 30 years old. Most people would want surgical interventions immediately without opting for conservative treatments due to time constraints and non-adherence to exercises. Furthermore, in the early stage of KOA, surgery should not be an option; however, most patients with KOA would still not adhere to the manual therapy and exercise therapy that has been prescribed. Manual therapy and exercise therapy during that stage should greatly help manage KOA symptoms and prevent rapid deterioration, progressing KOA quicker to the severe stage. Even in the later stage, manual therapy and exercise therapy shall be part of the treatment options while seeking surgical interventions.\n\n1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY\n\nThis systematic review study aims to disclose the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in improving KOA patients' pain and functional ability. The effectiveness of manual and exercise therapy can be measured using reliable outcome measures of pain and functional ability. A helpful guideline and assistance in advocating for the public to opt for manual therapy and exercise therapy to manage KOA symptoms will be a great success once the efficacy of these treatments has been\nproven.\n\n1.4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE(S)\n\nGeneral Objectives:\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in reducing pain and improving the functional ability of patients with KOA\n\nSpecific Objectives:\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in managing pain symptoms of KOA patients.\nTo systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in enhancing the functional ability of KOA patients.\n\n1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION(S)\n\nDoes manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively reduce the pain symptoms of patients with KOA?\nDoes manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively improve the functional ability of patients with KOA?\n\n1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS\n\nManual therapy and exercise therapy will reduce pain symptoms for KOA patients.\nManual therapy and exercise therapy will improve the functional ability of KOA patients.\n\n1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY\n\nSuppose this study aims to prove manual and exercise therapy's efficacy. In that case, it will be able to make a guideline for health professionals and the public, especially for individuals with KOA. Moreover, a solid guideline can advocate for the public and raise awareness of the conservative treatments they may seek to control the KOA symptoms, especially those in the early stage, and could prevent arthroplasty or joint replacement. Naturally, the human with pain perception will avoid moving; however, it is possible to move the body while in pain with the proper technique. Besides that, manual therapy is also there to help individuals with KOA reduce pain through the hands of health professionals. This study is not solely for individuals with KOA but is also great for those who aim to slow down the natural-ageing degeneration process, which leads to KOA.\n\n1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS\n\n1.8.1 Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)\n\nKnee osteoarthritis is a degenerative disorder of articular cartilage. It includes the pathology of wide tissues such as the meniscus, synovial membrane, and subchondral bone constituting the knee joint, ligament, joint capsule, tendon, and muscle (Kanamoto et al., 2020).\n\n1.8.2 Manual Therapy\n\nManual therapy is an advanced speciality area of physical therapy based on manual examination and treatment techniques integrated with exercise, patient education, and other physical therapy modalities to address pain, loss of function, and wellness. American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists (AAOMPT) Description of Advanced Specialty Practice (DASP) (2018) as cited from Physiopedia.\n\n1.8.3 Exercise Therapy\n\nExercise therapy consists of movements and physical activities that increase strength and function and reduce discomfort. (Australian Sports Physiotherapy, 2021)\n\n1.9 CHAPTER SUMMARY\n\nThe chapter started with a background study on KOA and manual therapy and exercise therapy as part of interventions done to improve individuals’ functional ability and continued with problem statements and the purpose of the study. Afterwards, this chapter presents the research objectives, questions, and hypothesis, guiding this systematic review study in assessing related articles and providing relevant and solid studies concerning the research's objectives, questions, and hypothesis. It then proceeded with the significance of the study to emphasise why it should be done and, lastly, explain the terms that are primarily used in this research."}, {"id": 30589, "actor": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet that involves plotting and visualizing the loss values of a model during training. Your task is to complete the code snippet by uncommenting the necessary line(s) of code and modifying the code to correctly display the loss values.\n\nWrite a function `plot_loss(history)` that takes a dictionary `history` as its input. The `history` dictionary contains two keys: `'loss'` and `'val_acc'`. The value associated with the `'loss'` key is a list of floating-point numbers representing the loss values of the model at each epoch during training. The value associated with the `'val_acc'` key is a list of floating-point numbers representing the validation accuracy of the model at each epoch during training. Your goal is to plot the loss values.\n\nThe function should accomplish the following tasks:\n1. Uncomment the line that plots the validation accuracy (`#plt.plot(history.history['val_acc'])`).\n2. Plot the loss values using the `plt.plot()` function, using the values from `'loss'` key in the `history` dictionary.\n3. Set the title of the plot to `'model loss'`.\n4.

In the given sentence, \"The more you try to reach the end, the farther away it seems\", the paradox lies in the fact that the more effort one puts in to achieve something, the more distant the goal appears. This can be represented mathematically as:\nd = k/e\nWhere 'd' is the perceived distance, 'k' is a constant, and 'e' is the effort put in. As 'e' increases, 'd' also increases, resulting in a paradoxical situation.\nTwo other examples of paradoxical situations in literature are:\n1.

Each member was part of the\nDMAIC tasks. Formation of such a small team of empowered R&D engineers at the\npoint of the process steps is typical in the LSS methodology and provides the required\ninputs to be gathered to improve the process. A time span[1] was assigned to complete\nthe DMAIC process, with the defined goal of 50 per cent reduction in idle wait time and\na reduction in the process variability through:\n• structured and standardized activities;\n• clearly defined transfer through optimum connections;\n• simple and specific process flow; and\n• small and rapid improvements.\nThe team started with asking the process questions and to gather the voices of\ncustomers, business and the employees in the process (VOC, VOB and VOE) to\nunderstand the critical process steps for the WPs for the process changes. The process\nsteps that did not need critical technical input were targeted for either significant\nreduction or outright elimination to achieve the target of the idle time elimination. In\naddition, the mandate to the team was to understand the “what is” state and the ideal\nstate of “what should be” in terms of the business process.\nThe team started with defining the high-level process flow in the then “present” form\n(Figure 2) to help us define the process boundaries of the configuration control process\nwe want to improve. There are two levels of review forums and team member approvals\nin the configuration control software system. The first thing to observe is that although\nthe activities are standardized, they are not structured. For example, the same team\nmembers who write the change and provide inputs also approve the WP in the computer\nsystem. In a manufacturing R&D environment, this could be large numbers of stakeholders ranging from finance to capacity to different technical areas such as\nmechanical engineering, materials science, physics, chemical engineering, applied\nmechanics, etc. Further, the flow is not simple for anyone wanting to change the process.\nThe information transfer also included so many stakeholders so that the principle of\n“one customer, one supplier, one method of information transfer” was not followed.\nAlso, the format of the WP was different for the two review levels, making it highly\ninconvenient for the authors. Finally, the team members linked the complexity of the\nprocess to the technical rigor – in other words, we did not realize that “Technical difficult\nproblems can be solved using simple business processes”!\nThe SIPOC table (Supplier-Inputs-Process-Outputs-Customers) as shown in Figure 3\nwas used to identify the requirements from the customers (R&D team, factory,\nmanagement and WP authors), the process inputs (software tool, WP template, change\nforums, etc.) together with the process requirements and suppliers. Following the SIPOC\ndiagram, we collected baseline data from R&D engineers via a questionnaire to\ndetermine the time required for each step of the configuration control process, the level\nof their satisfaction with the current process and specific improvement ideas. This\ninformation provided valuable input for the estimation of the current WP process cycle\nand active time and was also used for our future state discussion."}, {"id": 30667, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "I am drafting my gsoc proposal, and i am writing about the tasks of the first part. please formally format the following text, reorder appropriately and explain in detail as much as possible. \n\n Migrating content from the old website to the new website\nPEcAn’s current website at pecanproject.github.io is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Divorce is when two individuals decide to end their marriage. Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.\""}, {"id": 30713, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "can write me a shader unity that will deform grass to move like wind"}, {"id": 30714, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "could you generate an alphabet word cards for 4 years old kid"}, {"id": 30715, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "refactor this to useSelector hook\n\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport Template from './template'\nimport type { MapStateToProps } from 'd2/actions'\nimport type { OwnProps, StateProps } from './types'\n\nconst mapStateToProps: MapStateToProps = ({\n createRelease: { selectedNetworkExtras },\n}) => ({\n items: selectedNetworkExtras.map(({ id, price, shortLabel }) => ({\n id,\n label: shortLabel,\n price,\n })),\n})\n\nconst CartCard: React$ComponentType = connect(mapStateToProps)(Template)\n\nexport default CartCard"}, {"id": 30716, "actor": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "prompt": "what are some ways to get good startup ideas?"}, {"id": 30717, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a letter to my 6 year old son, from Santa, explaining that Santa Claus doesn't exist and well tell stories out of love"}, {"id": 30718, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "What behaviors or characteristics make you trust someone?"}, {"id": 30719, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "In addition to the given prompt, include a requirement that the specific characteristics of the garden must include at least one element that is not typically associated with beauty or gardening, such as a functional or sustainable feature.

The algorithm simulates the effect of each legal move on a game board, and then recursively evaluates the move by calling the `best_move` function with an increased depth. The goal is to find the best move for the current player, considering the potential moves and their subsequent evaluation.\n\nYour task is to implement the missing parts of the `best_move` function and complete the algorithm to make it work correctly.\n\nThe `best_move` function takes two parameters: `depth`, which represents the current depth in the game tree, and `board_cpy`, which is a copy of the game board. The function returns the evaluation value of the best move for the current player.\n\nTo implement the `best_move` function, you need to complete the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the `depth` is equal to a defined constant `MAX_DEPTH`. If it is, return the evaluation value of the current game state using a predefined `eval` function. \n\n2. Get a list of legal moves from the `board_cpy` using a predefined `get_legal_moves` function.\n\n3. Initialize two variables: `opt`, which represents the optimal evaluation value for the current player, and `index`, which represents the index of the best move.\n\n4. Iterate over each legal move using a for loop.\n\n5. Inside the loop, simulate the move by invoking the `move` method of `board_cpy` with the current legal move as an argument.\n\n6. After simulating the move, recursively call the `best_move` function with an increased `depth` and modified `board_cpy` object. Assign the returned value to a temporary variable `temp`.\n\n7. If `depth % 2` is equal to 0 and `temp` is greater than `opt`, update `opt` with `temp` and set `index` to the current loop index.\n\n8. If `depth % 2` is equal to 1 and `temp` is less than `opt`, update `opt` with `temp` and set `index` to the current loop index.\n\n9.

Discuss why the team is making the migration incrementally and why this is relevant to other high-performance engineering teams doing filesystem work debating Rust or Go. Use a witty, but chill voice.\n---\n\nNathan:\n\n- Organizational\n - Our team wants to write Rust. We think it’s neat and it makes us happy. This alone is \\*reason enough\\* to do it as long as it aligns with other goals in our organization.\n - Hiring for Rust-interested web-focused engineers is easier than hiring for Go-interested web-focused engineers.\n - We want to work with the Turbopack people and primitives. Creating our own internal “library” of code gives us the ability to row the boat together. We have similar needs and problems that aren’t addressed \\*anywhere else\\* and it’s important to go together as a team. (Go fast? Go alone. Go far? Go together.)\n- Community\n - There is a \\*strong\\* interest in Rust from the JavaScript community. This makes it more-accessible for people coming from JS-tooling-in-JS land, and enables community contributions.\n - We have had little engagement from the Go community in our projects, and few occasions to interact with them in external code. Not unexpected, but we’d like to build a community and we believe that we can be successful with that in Rust.\n- Ecosystem\n - The Node.js ecosystem is absolutely massive. Almost anything you need has been written in JS, or is forkable. We come from this world, and this is the expectation we have for depth, breadth, and maintenance.\n - The Rust ecosystem has a few extremely-high-quality core pieces that are in \\*everything\\*. `serde` is a work of art. `rayon` is fantastic. Those serve as foundational tools that have \\*solved\\* entire problem spaces in a consistent way for the entire community.\n - Algorithm research happens in Rust, not Go. New toys show up, implement a trait, and poof, they’re in your codebase.\n - The Go ecosystem is not easily discoverable and feels very dead. People regularly write one-off solutions to general problems. Most of the best things are Google-authored and fit with Google’s worldview, but not necessarily everybody else’s.\n - The Go ecosystem has frequently-used yet poorly-maintained libraries that are a core part of the experience (e.g. afero). spf13 “Holowaychuk'd” the Go ecosystem and then disappeared (and recently stepped away from Google and Go entirely).\n - The “correctness” quotient of libraries in Go is somewhere between JS and Rust. Not good enough to be 100% reliable, not as flexible as JS when you need to duckpunch something.\n- C Interop\n - As you get deeper and deeper into Go you start to discover that the best way to do certain tasks is to bind to a C library. zstd, libgit2, regular expressions, and more. This means that, \\*even without Rust adoption\\*, we were going to lose some of the development experience wins of Go.\n - This works “just fine” but the real point here is, once you’ve got a compiler toolchain setup for each of your targets for CGO, there’s little to prevent you from also making the small hop over to Rust. (Once we can compile with CGO, we can \\*also\\* compile to `c-archive` and have Rust call our Go code.)\n- Go Language Design and Priorities\n - Go is designed for network computing run in data centers. It \\*excels\\* at that. The ecosystem of libraries available in that space are of super-high quality. `context` is a work of art.\n - In comparison, Go shipped a read-only filesystem abstraction a couple years ago. It’s still read-only. Why? You don’t write to filesystems in a (Google) data center environment.\n - Our use case doesn’t align with the Go maintainers’ needs and use cases. That leads to needing to roll our own (lots of things) because they’re not a priority to address at language level.\n - No MSVC support.\n- Rust Language Design and Priorities\n - Rust has prioritized correctness over convenience. Paths? Not as easy to use, because the underlying primitive is not easy to use. It returns the complexity to the programmer to explicitly handle correctly. But we care about precisely that in a world where basically 90% of what we do is path handling.\n - In general we believe it is better-suited to ship Rust to a hostile environment like a user’s box than Go. Go’s stdlib “aligns” a lot of behaviors that can’t \\*actually\\* be aligned between platforms—most specifically around filesystem APIs … again a place that we care about.\n - Is able to build on the MSVC toolchain.\n- Vision\n - We want to, with localized heating, boil the JS ocean. (Starting at the places where people are, and slowly moving to boil the whole ocean.) We want to bring full incremental computation all the way from dev time into production. We’re working backward from production with Turbopack, and forward from the build tool with Turborepo. The next iteration of this is “infinitely granular DAG which includes the whole ecosystem.” Nobody else appears to be attempting that granularity.\n - Success here is a \\*massive\\* moat, possibly insurmountable. For context I would have said the same thing about C compilers, but Clang and LLVM have done it over the last 20 years. But 20 years is one hell of a moat and we can respond a lot faster than 20 years to maintain that separation.\n - Being the stewards for the community primitives (in this case `turbo` … which is what happens after repo/pack merger) gives us the ability to push the \\*entire\\* ecosystem forward, slowly increasing what is possible to even attempt.\n- Future\n - We believe that Rust is where the puck is heading. We want to help it get there, and be ready when that future arrives.\n\nNicholas:\n\n- Reasons for Rust\n - Performance\n - Not \\*really\\* valid because performance issues are less language constricted and more inherent architecture issues.\n - But maybe true? Too early to tell.\n - Ecosystem\n - IMO stuff like serde, swc, clap, etc. are good reasons to use Rust.\n - Go has separate interfaces for every text format (toml, json, yaml, etc)\n - Being able to use cargo to share code with the Turbopack people\n - Standardization with turbopack\n - Opens up a future for a whole suite of tooling in Rust\n - Our version of Rome (obviously don’t say that directly) (do we want to talk about future plans?)\n - Eventually use Turbopack’s graph infrastructure (maybe)\n - Go problems\n - Go and Windows.\n- Reasons against Rust\n - Slows down shipping velocity\n - We’ve done a really good job of limiting this. We’ve slowed down our shipping a little but still done a great job incrementally moving and keeping our existing users.\n - Ecosystem limitations\n - Globbing libraries are still a mess. Won’t match JS globbing behavior\n - Hard to determine standard practices\n - You will have less than ideal code.\n - The orphan rule will bite you.\n - Hiring isn’t hard, but the most senior rust developer you can find will have like 5 years of Rust experience, max.\n - Very easy to bike shed with macros, traits, funky types, refactoring, etc.\n - Just because Rust lets you refactor easily doesn’t mean you should.\n\nGreg\n\nConsolidating some points shamelessly stolen from above\n\n- Rust Positives\n - JS ↔ Rust interop is a good story, technically and community-wise\n - Rust ↔ C is a good story, and we use some tools written in C\n - Rust is growing at Vercel and with NextJS, specifically\n- Go Negatives\n - The Go ecosystem is all-or-nothing. Once you need to make use of functionality not written in Go, you lose a lot of the benefits of having been in Go. What we lose:\n - Easy cross-platform static binary generation\n - Compilation speed (still better than rust tho)\n - Writing portable code is hard \\*and\\* not a focus of the ecosystem.\n - Conditional compilation support is basic\n - Platform-related APIs are either least-common-denominator or fudged to look cross-platform\n - Mismatch with community priorities\n - The Go community seems focused on being the best tool for writing an RPC server.\n - `Context` and goroutines are great primitives for request-scoped work within a long-running process.\n - Getting an HTTP server up and running is easy, and GRPC and protobuf is not much harder.\n - Such software is often intended to run on a single platform, or does not interact significantly with the host platform, so a workflow such as developing on `macos` and deploying on `linux` is the straightforward happy path.\n - Interop with other ecosystems is not a priority.\n - `turbo` is a cross-platform CLI tool that interacts heavily with the local filesystem and process tree.\n - Some of the best tools for filesystem interactions are written in C, so interop is important\n - Differences exist between different platforms, we as developers need those differences surfaced to us so we can handle them appropriately.\n - \n\nAnthony’s notes from talking to Greg:\n\n- not necessarily about language features, let’s break some new ground\n- moreso about what we are buliding doesn’t align with the problem we’re trying to solve\n- Go is good for RPCing and webservers and that’s what the ecosystem cares about\n - Go will lie to you about platform specific differences (an ecosystem and community mindset)\n- we want good interop with JS, interop with OS’es, platform specific stuff\n- The JavaScript community is spending time learning Rust right now\n- Globbing and performance stuff is pretty meh, those are language specific features\n-"}, {"id": 30785, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "Write a funny birthday wish for a successful serial tech entrepreneur in Cape Town, South Africa using South African English."}, {"id": 30786, "actor": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "prompt": "Can you provide an Excel table showing the calculation and result of 12 divided by 3?"}, {"id": 30787, "actor": "Bash Scripting & Database Management", "prompt": "In Linux, How do I rename all the sub-folders and filenames to Camel Case"}, {"id": 30788, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "In what ways do you express empathy to ensure others feel seen and validated in their emotions?"}, {"id": 30789, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "What's a the safest way to teach my young kids how to swim ?"}, {"id": 30790, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "Have you ever overestimated or underestimated someone’s emotional reaction?

Out of the box, there are some great games and apps that can keep you occupied for quite a while (TowerFall anyone?). A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to do more with my Ouya console. I had a growing collection of Humble Bundle Android games that I wanted to play.\nProbably the most annoying aspect of playing with the Ouya is getting files on to the Ouya. One of the latest updates enabled access to external storage. This means you can load files on to a thumb drive (or external hard drive) and then plug that thumb drive into the Ouya to transfer/access. The problem is I’m lazy and I don’t want to walk back and forth every time I need to transfer files.\nIt is actually quite easy to load BitTorrent Sync on to Ouya. The device is running a modified version of Android 4.1. Below I’ll outline two methods for installing BitTorrent Sync. The first method is achieved by simply side-loading the app. Follow my instructions, and you’ll be up and running in 10 minutes. The second method involves rooting the Ouya and installing the Google Play store. This allows you to download the latest version of BitTorrent Sync for Android and keep it up to date.\nStep 1: On your Ouya, navigate to the “discover” section and click on the “app” category. Near the top should be an app called “FilePwn”. Download that. It will come in handy.\nStep 2: Retrieve btsync.apk from the Sync folder (see above), and place it on a thumb drive.\nStep 3: Open FilePwn, and navigate to /usbdrive (or a similar name). You should see btsync.apk. Click on it and install it.\nStep 4: Go back to the main Ouya menu and click on “Make”. Any apps you install that aren’t from the Ouya store will appear here. You should see an icon for BitTorrent Sync.\nMethod 2: Root and install the Google Play Store.\nNote: If you follow these steps exactly, everything should work. You’ll note that I have included a reboot at the end of a lot of the steps. Don’t skip this part.\nStep 1: On your Ouya, navigate to the “discover” section and click on the “app” category. Near the top should be an app called “FilePwn. Downlaod that. It will come in handy.\nStep 2: Load the following apps on to a thumb drive from the Sync folder (see above). Don’t bother with the btsync.apk. You will be installing from the Play Store.\nStep 3: Using FilePwn, navigate to /usbdrive and install OUYARoot.apk. After it is installed, open it. You’ll be presented with a very simple screen that has a single button. You can’t miss it. Click on the giant button to root your device. When this is done, return to FilePwn.\nStep 4: Install XposedInstaller.apk and open the program. After opening the program click on “Framework” and then “Install/Update”. Now Reboot (there’s a reboot button at the bottom of the screen).\nStep 5: Open FilePwn, navigate to your thumb-drive and install ModCollection4Ouya.apk. Now open XposedInstaller again, select “modules” and check the box for the Mod Collection for Ouya. This can be a little tricky. Use the touch panel on the controller to do this. Make sure you actually see the box filled in with a blue check.\nStep 6: For this step, you need to move the ps3ouya.zip from your thumb drive to the internal downloads folder. Open FilePwn, navigate to your thumb drive, select ps3ouya.zip and choose to move it to /storage/sdcard0/download. Open the ModCollection program and enable Google Play Store mod. Then click on “install play store”. This will only work if you have properly placed ps3ouya.zip in the download folder. Reboot.\nStep 6: Launch the Google Play Store and enter your Google credentials. Reboot.\nStep 7: Launch Google Play and search for “BitTorrent Sync”. Install.\n• Make sure you use all caps when inputting a Sync key.\n• At one point, I had an issue with the folders not syncing and I had to enable “use cellular data” in the BitTorrent Sync options. If you are having an issue with syncing, give this a shot.\n• You may want to enable the “disable auto update” option in the ModCollection. Every auto update will disable root.\nAaaaannnnddd done. That’s it. No more running back and forth with a thumb drive. I was able to download my Android apps from humblebundle.com (using BitTorrent!) and add them to my Sync folder. They automatically synced to my Ouya and I was able to install and play.\nI hope you enjoy your Sync-enabled Ouya. If you need me, I’ll be playing Metal Slug 3 for the next few days.

If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8 / 13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8 / 13 * 78 = 48 slices. Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48 - 20 = 28. The answer is 28.\nQuestion: Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\nAnswer: Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches. The answer is 12.\nQ: Jose is a collector of fine wines.

Researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the Côte d’Azur Observatory and elsewhere used observations made by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s (SOHO) Global Oscillations at Low Frequency (GOLF) instrument to measure solar oscillations, then used a new technique to determine the speed at which the solar core was spinning. What they did, the researchers explained in a statement, was study surface acoustic waves in the sun’s atmosphere. Some of those waves penetrate to the core and interact with gravity waves that have a “sloshing” motion similar to how water splashes around in a container that is half full. By detecting these sloshing motions, they were able to measure the acoustic waves and figure out how long it took them to travel from the surface to the core and back again. By applying this new method to 16 years worth of GOLF data, the research team determined that the solar core rotated once per week. Their findings have been reported in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Experts have speculated for more than two decades that the sun’s interior may be spinning faster than the surface, but they had never been able to accurately measure its oscillations before, study co-author Roger Ulrich, a professor emeritus of astronomy at UCLA, said in a statement. The SOHO space observatory has been orbiting the sun for more than 20 years, using its GOLF instrument to conduct solar oscillation measurements once every 10 seconds. Thanks to this data, the authors of the new study were able to definitely conclude that earlier speculation was correct, and that the interior portion of the sun does indeed spin more quickly than the outer parts. “We’ve been searching for these elusive g-waves [gravity waves] in our Sun for over 40 years, and although earlier attempts have hinted at detections, none were definitive. Finally, we have discovered how to unambiguously extract their signature,” lead author Eric Fossat from the Cote d’Azur Observatory explained in a statement released by the European Space Agency (ESA).

With colleagues, with partners, with customers… Is that information in safe hands? Or are files available to people who shouldn’t have access? Florbs mitigates the risk of data exposure by giving Google Workspace admins in-depth insights into file sharing habits. How? Let’s deepdive into 2 ways Florbs can help you:\n1) Identifying file sharing habits\n\n2) How to track where files end up\n\nHow to identify file sharing habits within your domain\nWhen collaborating within Google Workspace, there are multiple ways of sharing to other people’s Google Drive available. Depending on your domain settings, you can share files with:\n\nSpecific users\nSpecific groups\nThe whole domain (with a link)\nAnyone with the link (publicly accessible)\nAll four methods are reflected in your Florbs dashboard:\n\nThe blocks show you an overview of the amount of files that are shared by a specific method\nSo, what are we looking at?\n\nTotal shared:\n\nThe amount of files that a user has shared. E.g: the total amount of all sharing methods combined. This block will provide you with an indication whether there is a lot of (external) collaboration happening.\nShared with anyone:\nThe amount of files that are shared publicly. Everyone with the URL to a file is able to access these files.\nDomain shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with the whole domain. Everyone within the same domain as the person who shared it is able to access these files.\nGroup shares:\nThe amount of files shared with a group. When you hover over this block, you are able to differentiate between internal and external groups.\nUser shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with specific users. The most precise and transparent way of file-sharing. Hovering over the block differentiates between internal and external users as well.\n\nBy using your Florbs dashboard, you can see which sharing methods are used the most. And, whether file sharing is done safely. When combining this with the extensive search functionality, you can also track what kind of files are shared which way.\nThis overview shows you if you need to educate your whole organization about sharing habits, or only a few users.\nShare safely, share specifically\nAlthough all different sharing methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is a safe option to stick to the principle of least privilege; If people don’t need full access, don’t grant them full access. File sharing management is as important as other safety measures within your domain.\n\nIt is possible to restrict sharing publicly across your domain entirely. However, there are a lot of situations in which files are meant to be shared publicly. If you restrict file sharing, those files will be duplicated/downloaded or sent as attachments . And they will float around in all kinds of different versions. This means that although you won’t see the sharing within your Google Workspace anymore, it is still happening. Luckily, Florbs enables to monitor your Google Drive without forbidding all kinds of options.\n\nDeeper into sharing habits\nLet’s look at the sharing habits of Scott as shown on the screenshot. He shares a lot of files with groups and users, but a lot of them publicly as well. With the amount of files that Scott shared externally, it could be a good idea to check what is happening. Although sharing files using the ‘anyone with the link’ ’option could have been done intentional, it could be done due to being in a hurry or out of ignorance about better sharing methods as well.\n\nBy using the extensive search function you can take a look at what kind of files are shared. This helps you to make a proper estimation whether you want these files floating around, or if you need to revoke some permissions. Educating colleagues on other ways of sharing or a good conversation about a possible need of groups/shared drives is highly recommended when you identify a lot of shares using this method.\n\nSo, are you wondering how to check these habits thoroughly? Let’s deep dive into the extensive search functionality.\nIt can take a bit of effort, but you can reduce the risk of potential trouble: Educate people on sharing methods, create proper groups and shared drives and arrange clear agreements on- and offboarding when projects or collaborations end.\nHow to track where Google Drive files end up\nThere are two ways to track where data ends up. There is an extensive search functionality where you can search for data that matches specific criteria. However, if you want to analyze the data in less depth, there are some blocks that offer a clear overview as well.\n\nThe blocks with ‘sharing domains’ and ‘shared external’ offer a quick glance into your domain. They show – you guessed it – the domain files are shared with and with which mail addresses the most files are shared. The blocks are quite useful for three purposes:\n\n1) to have an overview of what’s happening within your domain,\n\n2) to identify where possible data exposure could occur and\n\n3) to track remarkable changes.\n\nThese graphs show you important information on the sharing habits of your domain. They identify the domains and users with which the most files are shared. Apparently, there are quite a few shares with personal email addresses (hotmail.com and gmail.com . And what about all those shares with @example.com? Is that collaboration still in place or should these permissions be withdrawn?\n\nDrive audit – the extensive search functionality\nThe extensive search function allows a more in depth insight into possible data exposure. It is useful to do some research on specific files or domains you’ve seen in the overview or to do some routine checks on specific terms or domains.\nThere are multiple filters available, the filters allow to search for files based on:\n\nName, file ID, shared drive location\nWho files are shared with\nThe file owner\nLocation: shared drives, my drives or orphaned\nExposure: anyone with the link , only domain with the link, restricted or not shared\nThe domain the files are shared with\nType of file (drive files like sheets, docs, forms and lot of other files like audio, video, Apps Scripts, Shortcuts and such as well)\nOr combine multiple of these filters at the same time.\n\nIdentified permissions that need to change? By using these filters you can create bulk actions with just a few clicks. This allows you to change permissions for multiple Google Drive files at once. Select the files you want to change permissions for, click on ‘add action’ in the upper right corner and change permissions immediately. (Read more about bulk actions and how to create them at this blog)\n\nAnd voila, you can monitor all file-sharing within your domain. Adopt a more in depth file sharing approach, just keep an eye on the file management of the domain or manage your data exposure extensively.\n\nShare this\nLinkedIn\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nGoogle Workspace management\n\nAbout us\nContact\nCareers\nAdmin Automation\nSecurity & Auditing\nEmail Signature Management\nStart for free\nGet a demo\nPartner\nGeneral Terms and Conditions\nPrivacy policy\nPrivacy Statement (App)"}, {"id": 30887, "actor": "Time & Date Management & Modular Arithmetic", "prompt": "Can you provide a list of proverbs related to the concept of time?
