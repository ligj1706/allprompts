In 2008, he voiced Mr. Ping in Kung Fu Panda, the adopted father of Po and was nominated for an Annie Award for his performance; he later reprised the role on Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special and won an Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Television Production. Furthermore, he and Lucy Liu have been collaborated in the feature film series and in the television series adaptation, Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness. After the release of the third film he stated that he hoped to continue in the role, though due to his advanced age the filmmakers should start work on it quickly. In 2015, Hong voiced Azmorigan on Star Wars Rebels as well as the Sugi arms dealer, Endente in an unfinished four part story arc of Star Wars: The Clone Wars; the rough animatics for the entire arc have been published on the official Star Wars website.\n\nBased on this passage, who plays po dad in kung fu panda?\nStudent B:OK...

By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations, including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas. In 1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel (47 %) were significantly higher than that of US civilians (30 %) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness. The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from stores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking. In 1986, the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who announced, \"an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services.\" It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990. In 1992, the DeCA Directive 40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993, the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) became the first smoke-free Navy ship. By 1994, the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or leased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year phase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7, 2002. Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians. And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations?\nStudent B:"}, {"id": 1409, "actor": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "prompt": "Please give a list of web-based tools that will accompany chatGOT to support kids education"}, {"id": 1410, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "It's my son's birthday today but he's home sick from daycare.

They make up slang words. Millions of people watch their Minecraft and makeup videos. Millions of dollars are made from their work.\n\nSo why don't teenagers get more credit?\n\nAdults often criticize teens. They say youths cannot control their emotions. Recently, we learned more about the brain from a study. It has helped us to understand teenagers' behavior better. \n\nSpecifically, we learned about the brain's prefrontal cortex. It is the part that handles planning and decision-making. It is not fully grown until around the age of 25. So, teenagers are more likely to take risks. \n\nThis part of the study helped to explain adolescents' sometimes confusing behavior. However, it left adults more focused on how teens take risks. They did not praise the brain's role in learning and creating.\n\nThat has frustrated some researchers. \n\nOur Brains Grow At Their Own Pace\nThe report on adolescent development came out in 2019. The research was carried out by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The report found that some news headlines did not tell the whole story. Adults have been too concerned with teenagers' fragility. In turn, many completely misunderstood recent science.\n\nThe report is part of a growing effort. Nonprofit groups and scientists are rewriting the story. It is true that the \"emotional\" and \"logical\" parts of teens' brains grow at different speeds. But that is not always a bad thing, researchers said. We easily overlook something. Risk-taking can help teens learn and grow. \n\nPreparing For Adulthood\nAdriana Galván helps to lead UCLA's Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory. UCLA is short for the University of California, Los Angeles. Fearlessness is exactly what makes adolescents creative. It can lead to social change too, she said.\n\nThe teenage brain's characteristics help to prepare them for adulthood. They gain a sort of superpower in learning and creativity. Teenage brains can quickly adjust, like in childhood. They build up new connections. Unused connections are shed. But teens also start to think abstractly. That is an adult ability. Teenage brains can imagine the future, Galván said. They also can make social connections.\n\nBrains Respond To Positive Feedback\nRecent research has focused on other brain regions. Such parts involve teenagers' social and emotional development. It appears that these regions do not develop by themselves. They are building connections to other parts of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is just one of those parts. That process is just as important as the maturation itself.\n\nFor example, Galván has researched the brain's striatum. It is a region connected with reward-seeking behavior. She wanted to understand its connection to the hippocampus. That brain region is associated with learning and memory. Her work suggests that the connection is especially strong in teens. \n\nIt appears that adolescents learn from positive feedback. They are more likely than adults to learn that way. Positive feedback could be used more in education, she said. Teachers could use that reward system to help the students learn, she said. \n\nTeen Brains Are Wired For Risks\nJoanna Lee Williams is an education professor at the University of Virginia. She contributed to the National Academies report. Risks can be healthy, too, she said. Deciding to join the marching band would be an example.\n\nThat does not mean lifting all limits on teenage behavior. But parents and educators can start by understanding one thing. Some risks are good, Williams says. They are key for learning and creating.\n\nWilliams admits she is looking from a birds-eye view. The findings will not solve all conflicts between adults and teenagers. Still, teens' sensitivity to rewards means they might not just ignore risks. Instead, they might think of them positively. Adults can take advantage of that. They might not need to jump to punishment. Rewards can help teens to better learn from mistakes.\n\nTeens Have A Lot To Contribute\nThe adolescent brain does not grow alone, Galván said. It develops \"in different environments,\" she said. Families would be an example. Any change in an environment can change a teenager's growth, for better or worse. \n\nWilliams sees \"an age of opportunity\" for adolescents. We know better how they learn. However, that does not mean it will be easy. There are still challenges. \n\nShe sees teens leading social movements. They bring energy. Throughout history, teens have brought new ideas into public life, Williams said.

Earlier this year, Mr. Strube flouted the furor in Europe over genetically modified crops by launching a 700 million euro ($664 million) research blitz in plant biotechnology.

The function should return `True` if the line \"Entering end of container holding pattern... end when done\" exists in the log file, and `False` otherwise.\n\nAssume the log file exists and is not empty, and that the pattern string appears only once in the log file.\n\nFunction signature: `def container_finished(log_path: str) -> bool`\n\n**Example**\n```\n# Contents of the log file\n# log.txt\n-------------------------\nINFO: Container started!\nINFO: Running task...\nINFO: Task completed successfully!\nINFO: Entering end of container holding pattern... end when done or enter container with shell\n-------------------------\n\ncontainer_finished(\"log.txt\") => True\n```"}, {"id": 1445, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "If you split a dozen eggs equally into two baskets and then remove three eggs from one basket, how many eggs are left in each basket?"}, {"id": 1446, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "html, body\n{\n height: 100%;\n width: 100%;\n overflow: hidden;\n}\nnav, main\n{\n margin-right: 10px;\n margin-left: 10px;\n height: 100%;\n vertical-align: text-top;\n overflow: scroll;\n display: inline-block;\n}\n.nav-img, .nav-link /\\*, .nav-element\\*/\n{\n vertical-align: baseline;\n display: inline-block;\n}\n.nav-children\n{\n vertical-align: top;\n margin-top: 20px;\n display: block\n}\n\nlet nav = document.getElementById(\"main-nav\");\nlet main = document.getElementById(\"main\");\nclass Nav{\n constructor(main\\_element){\n this.elements = [];\n this.main\\_element = main\\_element;\n this.name = \"Error name as not gived\";\n }\n add(element){\n this.elements.push(element)\n }\n initialise(){\n let main;\n let elements;\n let to\\_follow = [];\n main = ``\n if (this.elements.length == 0){\n to\\_follow = [[this.main\\_element.id, false]]\n } else {\n to\\_follow = [[this.main\\_element.id, true]]\n main = `![](develop.svg)`\n }\n main += `[${this.name}](#${this.main_element.id})\n `\n for (const element of this.elements){\n let [main\\_, to\\_follow\\_] = element.initialise();\n main += main\\_;\n to\\_follow = to\\_follow.concat(to\\_follow\\_);\n }\n main += \"\";\n return [main, to\\_follow];\n }\n}\nclass Follow{\n constructor(id, actual, doc, link, img, child){\n this.id = id;\n this.doc = doc;\n this.link = link;\n this.actual = actual;\n this.img = img;\n this.child = child;\n this.developed = false;\n }\n in(){\n this.link.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n }\n partial(){\n this.link.style.backgroundColor = \"blue\";\n }\n out(){\n this.link.style.backgroundColor = \"unset\";\n }\n call(){\n console.log(\"called\")\n if (this.developed){\n console.log(\"if\");\n this.img.src = \"develop.svg\";\n this.developed = false;\n this.child.style.display = \"none\";\n } else {\n console.log(\"else\");\n this.developed = true;\n this.img.src = \"undevelop.svg\"\n this.child.style.display = \"inline-block\";\n }\n }\n}\nfunction Get(nav, main\\_element){\n let name = \"Le nom n'a pas pu être récupéré;\";\n let new\\_nav;\n for (section of main\\_element.children){\n if (section.id.startsWith(main\\_element.id)){\n new\\_nav = new Nav(section);\n Get(new\\_nav, section);\n nav.add(new\\_nav);\n } else if(section.nodeName.toLowerCase() == \"name\"){\n name = section.innerHTML;\n section.style.display = \"none\";\n }\n }\n nav.name = name\n}\nfunction Install(nav\\_element, main){\n let f\\_to\\_follow = [];\n let f\\_main = \"\";\n for (section of main.children){\n if (section.id.startsWith(\"section-\")){\n let nav = new Nav(section)\n Get(nav, section);\n let [main\\_, to\\_follow] = nav.initialise();\n f\\_main += main\\_;\n f\\_to\\_follow = f\\_to\\_follow.concat(to\\_follow);\n }\n }\n nav\\_element.innerHTML = f\\_main;\n return f\\_to\\_follow;\n}\nlet to\\_follow = Install(nav, main)\nlet followed = [];\nfor (follow of to\\_follow){\n let actual = document.getElementById(`nav-element-${follow[0]}`);\n let link = document.getElementById(`nav-link-${follow[0]}`);\n let children = document.getElementById(`nav-chlidren-${follow[0]}`);\n let doc = document.getElementById(`${follow[0]}`);\n let img = false;\n if (follow[1] == true){\n img = document.getElementById(`nav-img-${follow[0]}`);\n }\n let follow\\_class = new Follow(follow[0], actual, doc, link, img, children);\n followed.push(follow\\_class);\n if (follow[1] == true){\n img.addEventListener(\"click\", function (){\n follow\\_class.call();\n });\n }\n}\nconsole.log(followed);\n\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n for (const follow of followed){\n console.log(follow);\n var rect = follow.doc.getBoundingClientRect();\n if (rect.top <= window.innerHeight){\n follow.in();\n } else if (rect.bottom >= 0 && 1 == 0) {\n follow.partial();\n } else {\n follow.out();\n }\n }\n});\n\nDithon doc\n\n\nTypes\nTypes\n=====\nDithon librairie contain some types.\nsnowflake\nSnowflake\n=========\nSnowflake corespond of an discord id.
