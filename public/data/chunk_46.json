Your task is to analyze the code and determine its behavior.\n\nThe `handle_storage` class is designed to manage some sort of handle in a program. In this code snippet, the move assignment operator `operator=(handle_storage&& other)` is defined for the `handle_storage` class. This operator is commonly used to efficiently transfer resources from one object to another without the need for unnecessary copying.\n\nInside the `operator=`, the `_handle` member variable of the current object (`this`) is assigned the value of the `_handle` member variable of the `other` object. Then, the `reset()` function is called on the `other` object, effectively taking ownership of the handle in `other` and leaving it in a default-constructed state.\n\nYour task is to analyze this code snippet and determine the following:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the move assignment operator?\n2. How does the move assignment operator accomplish its purpose?\n3. What is the effect of calling the move assignment operator on the current object (`this`)?\n4. What is the effect of calling the move assignment operator on the `other` object?\n5. What is the return value of the move assignment operator?\n\nProvide your answers as a multi-line string containing the answers to all the questions."}, {"id": 7010, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "Plan a 4 day trip to Cincinnati."}, {"id": 7011, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "Who or what influences your ethical beliefs and why?"}, {"id": 7012, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "I have a Mongo DB collection containing an Array property called \"list\" in which the items are objects with a property \"name\".
