The gradient magnitude represents the intensity of the change in pixel values, while the gradient orientation represents the direction of the change.\n3. Group several cells together to form a block. A block contains multiple cells and is used to normalize the HOG representation.\n4. For each block, concatenate the gradient magnitudes of the cells within the block.

Learn how your app can access Genius's content and community this easily too!\nAdd Genius Annotations To Your Own Site\n\nIn addition to interacting with Genius annotations through the API, it's easy to make any page annotatable and display annotations you've created on it. Just add the script tag:\n\nRegistering Your Application\nFirst, visit the Genius API Client management page and create an API client for your application. This will provide you with a client\\_id and a client\\_secret that you'll use to identify your application to Genius. The redirect\\_uri is used for authenticating Genius users with your application. You can change it later. The API Client will belong to the user account signed in to Genius when it's created.\n\nMaking Requests\nThe available endpoints are listed below in the resources section, along with embedded examples showing how they work and what they return.\n\nGenius uses OAuth2 for authentication. All API requests must be authenticated. There are plenty of libraries available to help with this part of your integration. There's also a detailed guide below if you're committed to implementing it yourself.\n\nResources\nAnnotations\nAn annotation is a piece of content about a part of a document. The document may be a song (hosted on Genius) or a web page (hosted anywhere). The part of a document that an annotation is attached to is called a referent.\n\nAnnotation data returned from the API includes both the substance of the annotation and the necessary information for displaying it in its original context.\n\napi.genius.com/\nannotations/10225840\n Authorization: Bearer\nAccess Token\nSee details about using an access token in the authentication section below.\n \nGET /annotations/:id\nData for a specific annotation.\n\nid ID of the annotation\n10225840\ntext\\_format Format for text bodies related to the document.

Each referent is associated with a web page or a song and may have one or more annotations. Referents can be searched by the document they are attached to or by the user that created them.\n\nWhen a new annotation is created either a referent is created with it or that annotation is attached to an existing referent.\n\napi.genius.com/\nreferents?web\\_page\\_id=10347\n Authorization: Bearer\nAccess Token\nSee details about using an access token in the authentication section below.\n \nGET /referents\nReferents by content item or user responsible for an included annotation.\n\nYou may pass only one of song\\_id and web\\_page\\_id, not both.\n\ncreated\\_by\\_id ID of a user to get referents for\nUser ID\nsong\\_id ID of a song to get referents for\nSong ID\nweb\\_page\\_id ID of a web page to get referents for\n10347\ntext\\_format Format for text bodies related to the document.

See details of each option here\nText Format\nAuthentication\nAccess for Apps Without Users\nIf your application doesn't include user-specific behaviors you can use the client access token associated with your API instead of tokens for authenticated users. These tokens are only valid for read-only endpoints that are not restricted by a required scope.\n\nYou can get a client access token by clicking \"Generate Access Token\" on the API Client management page.\n\nGenius uses the OAuth2 standard for making API calls on behalf of individual users. Requests are authenticated with an Access Token sent in an HTTP header (or as a request parameter if you must).\n\nAll interaction with the API must be done over HTTPS.\n\nAn example request would look like this:\n\nhttps://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize?\nclient\\_id=YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID&\nredirect\\_uri=YOUR\\_REDIRECT\\_URI&\nscope=REQUESTED\\_SCOPE&\nstate=SOME\\_STATE\\_VALUE&\nresponse\\_type=code\nGetting an Access Token\nStart by directing a user of your application to Genius's authentication page at https://api.genius.com/oauth/authorize with the following query parameters:\n\nclient\\_id: Your application's Client ID, as listed on the API Client management page\nredirect\\_uri: The URI Genius will redirect the user to after they've authorized your application; it must be the same as the one set for the API client on the management page\nscope: The permissions your application is requesting as a space-separated list (see available scopes below)\nstate: A value that will be returned with the code redirect for maintaining arbitrary state through the authorization process\nresponse\\_type: Always \"code\"\nMore About State\nOne important use for this value is increased security—by including a unique, difficult to guess value (say, a hash of a user session value), potential attackers can be prevented from sending phony redirects to your app.\n\nOn the authentication page the user can choose to allow your application to access Genius on their behalf. They'll be asked to sign in (or, if necessary, create an account) first. Then the user is redirected to https://YOUR\\_REDIRECT\\_URI/?code=CODE&state=SOME\\_STATE\\_VALUE.\n\nYour application can exchange the code query parameter from the redirect for an access token by making a POST request to https://api.genius.com/oauth/token with the following request body data:\n\n{\n \"code\": \"CODE\\_FROM\\_REDIRECT\",\n \"client\\_id\": \"YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_ID\",\n \"client\\_secret\": \"YOUR\\_CLIENT\\_SECRET\",\n \"redirect\\_uri\": \"YOUR\\_REDIRECT\\_URI\",\n \"response\\_type\": \"code\",\n \"grant\\_type\": \"authorization\\_code\"\n}\ncode: The code query parameter from the redirect to your redirect\\_uri\nclient\\_secret: Your application's Client Secret, as listed on the API Client management page\ngrant\\_type: Aways \"authorization\\_code\"\nclient\\_id: As above\nredirect\\_uri: As above\nresponse\\_type: As above\nMost of these are the same values as used in the initial request.\n\n{\n \"access\\_token\": \"ACCESS\\_TOKEN\"\n}\nThe response body will be an object with the token as the value for the access\\_token key. Save the token and use it to make requests on behalf of the authorizing user.\n\nAvailable Scopes\nAccess tokens can only be used for resources that are covered by the scopes provided when they created. These are the available scopes and the endpoints they grant permission for:\n\nScope Endpoints\nme GET /account\ncreate\\_annotation POST /annotations\nmanage\\_annotation PUT /annotations/:id\nDELETE /annotations/:id\nvote PUT /annotations/:id/upvote\nPUT /annotations/:id/downvote\nPUT /annotations/:id/unvote\nUsing An Access Token\nGET /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: CompuServe Classic/1.22\nAccept: application/json\nHost: api.genius.com\nAuthorization: Bearer ACCESS\\_TOKEN\nTo make authenticated requests with an access token, include it in an HTTP Authorization header preceded by the word \"Bearer\" and a space. For example, the value of the header could be Bearer 1234tokentokentoken.\n\nPassing the token in the authorization header is the preferred way to authenticate API requests. However, the API also supports providing the token as the access\\_token query parameter of a GET request or element of a POST body.\n\nResponse Format\nGET https://api.genius.com/web\\_pages/lookup?canonical\\_url=http://example.com\n{\n \"meta\": {\n \"status\": 200\n },\n \"response\": {\n \"web\\_page\": {\n \"annotation\\_count\":7,\n \"id\": 1480,\n ...\n }\n }\n}\nAll Genius API responses are JSON. Every JSON response has a meta field with a status value that is an integer representation of the HTTP status code for the response.\n\nFor successful requests, there is also a top-level response field which will be a nested object. For example, a request for details about annotations on a web page:\n\nErrors\nGET https://api.genius.com/apples\n{\n \"meta\": {\n \"status\": 404,\n \"message\": \"Not found\"\n }\n}\nIf a request fails or errors (i.e. the status values is 4xx or 5xx). the meta field will also have a message value that is a string with details about the error. For example, a request to a non-existent API endpoint:\n\nText Formatting (text\\_format option)\n{\n \"plain\": \"A hilarious word!\",\n \"html\": \"<p>A hilarious word!</p>\",\n \"dom\": {\n \"tag\": \"root\",\n \"children\": [ {\n \"tag\": \"p\",\n \"children\": [ \"A hilarious word!\" ]\n } ]\n }\n}\nMany API requests accept a text\\_format query parameter that can be used to specify how text content is formatted. The value for the parameter must be one or more of plain, html, and dom. The value returned will be an object with key-value pairs of formats and results:\n\nplain is just plain text, no markup\nhtml is a string of unescaped HTML suitable for rendering by a browser\ndom is a nested object representing and HTML DOM hierarchy that can be used to programmatically present structured content\n\n----\n\nWrite me a NodeJS authentication flow for this API using ExpressJS"}, {"id": 33126, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "How does the Jubilee Pool compare to other lidos in terms of its history and architecture?"}, {"id": 33127, "actor": "Cooking & Healthy Eating", "prompt": "What can be cooked on steam?"}, {"id": 33128, "actor": "Business Marketing & Social Media Strategy", "prompt": "Topic: Building a digital business with A.I.\nFor the above topic, what are some common aspirations that people have?"}, {"id": 33129, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet that uses the `VirtualAlloc` function to allocate memory in a Windows operating system.\n\n```cpp\n\tAddress=VirtualAlloc(0,Size,MEM_COMMIT,PAGE_NOACCESS);\n\tif(!Address) {\n\t\tcerr<<\"VirtualAllocFailed!!!\\n\";\n\t\treturn 0;\n```\n\nYour task is to complete the code by handling the case when `VirtualAlloc` fails.

The three are attending the preliminary meetings but will not enter the conclave.\nPaolo Gabriele, the pope’s butler, was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. The documents alleged corruption and infighting over the running of its bank. Gabriele was jailed and later pardoned by Benedict.\nBenedict decided to make the report available only to his successor but one Vatican official said the three elderly cardinals who wrote it could “use their discernment to give any necessary guidance” to fellow cardinals without violating their pact of secrecy about its specific contents.\nAt two news conferences on Monday, both the Vatican spokesman and two American cardinals refused to be drawn on the report and whether cardinals had asked to be briefed on it.\nSpecific matters discussed at the preliminary meetings are covered by secrecy.\n“Certainly, there can be various members of the college of cardinals who want information they feel is useful or pertinent to the situation of the curia,” spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said, referring to the central Vatican administration.\nChicago’s Cardinal Francis George was equally coy when asked if cardinals wanted to be briefed on the report.\n“As far as the state of the church here in Rome is concerned, I would imagine that as we move along there will be questioning of cardinals involved in the governing of the curia to see what they think has to be changed and in that context anything can come up,” George said at a separate news briefing.\nCardinals will be using the meetings this week to get to know each other and decide when to start a conclave to choose a man to lead the 1.2 billion-member church.\nThe Vatican appears to be aiming to have a new pope elected next week and officially installed several days later so he can preside over the Holy Week ceremonies starting with Palm Sunday on March 24 and culminating in Easter the following Sunday.\n“The thing that is in the back of all our minds, I think, is Holy Week. We’d like to be done before Holy Week starts, have a pope, and we all go back to our dioceses,” George said.\nHigh on the agenda at the general congregations will be the daunting challenges facing the next pontiff, including the sexual abuse crisis in the church and the Vatileaks scandal.\n“We need a man of governance, by that I mean a man who is able with the people he chooses to help him in an intimate way to govern the church,” Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, the former Archbishop of Westminster in London, told BBC radio.\nThe cardinals will hold one or two meetings a day. The date of the conclave will be decided after all the 115 cardinal electors arrive. Twelve still had not arrived by Monday.\nIt is widely expected to start next week.\nThe crisis involving sexual abuse of children by priests and inappropriate behavior among adult clerics continues to haunt the church and has rarely been out of the headlines.\nOne elector - Cardinal Keith O’Brien - quit as Edinburgh archbishop last week and pulled out of attending the conclave because of accusations that he behaved inappropriately with priests and seminarians in the past.\nHe at first denied the allegations but on Sunday issued a statement apologizing that “my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal”.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Could you provide more information on the secret report into leaks about alleged corruption and mismanagement in the Vatican, and why some cardinals are requesting to be briefed on its contents?"}, {"id": 33203, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "explain \"infantile amnesia\" with citations from researchers who study it"}, {"id": 33204, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "With no explanation, chose the best option from \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\". Why does the author indicate that \"The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area\"(paragraph 5)?\nIn 1977 ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson recorded a dramatic example of how social interactions can produce and enforce regular spacing in a population. They studied competition and nest spacing in populations of stingless bees in tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. Though these bees do no sting, rival colonies of some species fight fiercely over potential nesting sites.\nStingless bees are abundant in tropical and subtropical environments, where they gather nectar and pollen from a wide variety of flowers. They generally nest in trees and live in colonies made up of hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson observed that some species of stingless bees are highly aggressive to members of their species from other colonies, while other species are not. Aggressive species usually forage in groups and feed mainly on flowers that occur in high-density clumps. Nonaggressive species feed singly or in small groups and on more widely distributed flowers.\nHubbell and Johnson studied several species of stingless bees to determine whether there is a relationship between aggressiveness and patterns of colony distribution. They predicted that the colonies of aggressive species would show regular distributions, while those of nonaggressive species would show random or closely grouped (clumpeD. distribution. They concentrated their studies on a thirteen-hectare tract of tropical dry forest that contained numerous nests of nine species of stingless bees.\nThough Hubbell and Johnson were interested in how bee behavior might affect colony distributions, they recognized that the availability of potential nest sites for colonies could also affect distributions.So as one of the first steps in their study, they mapped the distributions of trees suitable for nesting. They found that potential nest trees were distributed randomly through the study area. They also found that the number of potential nest sites was much greater than the number of bee colonies. What did these measurements show the researchers? The number of colonies in the study area was not limited by availability of suitable trees, and a clumped or regular distribution of colonies was not due to an underlying clumped or regular distribution of potential nest sites.\nHubbell and Johnson mapped the nests of five of the nine species of stingless bees accurately, and the nests of four of these species were distributed regularly. All four species with regular nest distributions were highly aggressive to bees from other colonies of their own species. The fifth species was not aggressive, and its nests were randomly distributed over the study area.\nThe researchers also studied the process by which the aggressive species establish new colonies. Their observations provide insights into the mechanisms that establish and maintain the regular nest distribution of these species. Aggressive species apparently mark prospective nest sites with pheromones, chemical substances secreted by some animals for communication with other members of their species. The pheromone secreted by these stingless bees attracts and aggregates members of their colony to the prospective nest site; however, it also attracts workers from other nests.\nIf workers from two different colonies arrive at the prospective nest at the same time, they may fight for possession. Fights may be escalated into protracted battles.The researchers observed battles over a nest tree that lasted for two weeks. Each dawn, fifteen to thirty workers from two competing colonies arrived at the contested nest site. The workers from the two colonies faced off in two swarms and displayed and fought with each other. In the displays, pairs of bees faced each other, slowly flew vertically to a height of about three meters, and then grappled each other to the ground. When the two bees hit the ground, they separated, faced off, and performed another aerial display. Bees did not appear to be injured in these fights, which were apparently ritualized. The two swarms abandoned the battle at about 8 or 9 A.M. each morning, only to re-form and begin again the next day just after dawn. While this contest over an unoccupied nest site produced no obvious mortality, fights over occupied nests sometimes kill over 1,000 bees in a single battle.\n\nA: To introduce the hypothesis that, within the same species, not all colonies are aggressive.\nB: To indicate that research results confirmed that nest distribution was related to aggressiveness.\nC: To point out that both aggressive and nonaggressive species are equally successful at finding nest sites.\nD: To identify research results that contradicted Hubbell and Johnson's original hypothesis."}, {"id": 33205, "actor": "Prime Numbers & Mathematical Symbols", "prompt": "46298385314 / 1 =?\nNumbers and symbols only, please."}, {"id": 33206, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "I'm in bed but I can't sleep.

The technique involves blowing a very fine wind over the surface of the crystal at various angles to detect boundaries (indicated by molecules that are exposed to the wind). This is repeated with different wind directions and the boundaries observed for each direction are recorded. Your team has already collected the data, but – as is often the case with applied science – now the real work, analysis, must begin.\n\nFor a given crystal, you will receive the directions in which wind blew over the surface, and the locations of all boundaries encountered by each of these winds. For a wind blowing in direction (wx, wy), a boundary is defined as a location (x, y) such that a molecule exists at (x, y) and no molecule exists at (x − wx, y − wy). Note that for technical reasons wx and wy are not necessarily relatively prime.\n\nThe data might not uniquely determine the structure of the crystal. You must find the two unique structures with the minimal and maximal number of molecules consistent with the observations.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, nine different molecules are directly encountered by the given winds. There must be a molecule at location (3, 3) because otherwise (4, 2) would be a boundary for the third wind. For similar reasons, there must be molecules at (4, 4) and (5, 5). There cannot be any further molecules as they would result in additional observations for some of the winds.\n\ninput\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers dx, dy, and k, where dx and dy (1 ≤ dx, dy ≤ 103) are the maximum dimensions of the crystal structure, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10) is the number of times wind was blown over the crystal.\n\nEach of the remaining k lines specifies the data for one wind. These lines each start with two integers wx and wy (-dx ≤ wx ≤ dx and -dy ≤ wy ≤ dy, but not both zero) denoting the direction of the wind. Then comes an integer b (0 ≤ b ≤ 105) giving the number of boundaries encountered by this wind. The line finishes with b distinct pairs of integers x, y (1 ≤ x ≤ dx and 1 ≤ y ≤ dy) listing each observed boundary.\n\nYou may assume the input is consistent with at least one crystal and that no molecules exist outside the specified dimensions.\n\noutput\n\nOutput two textual representations of the crystal structure separated by an empty line. Each structure has dy rows of dx characters, with the top-left corner corresponding to location (1, 1).

Each `student_team` object is expected to have a `title` attribute.\n- Inside the loop, there is another loop that iterates over a list of `master_repo_names`.\n- In each iteration of the inner loop, the function checks if the `title` of the `student_team` matches the `master_repo_name`.\n- If there is a match, the function executes a series of assertions:\n  * It asserts that the `title` of the `actual_issue` (an object) is equal to the `title` of the `expected_issue` (another object).\n  * It asserts that the `state` of the `actual_issue` is equal to `expected_state`.\n  * It asserts that the `description` of the `actual_issue` is equal to the `body` of the `expected_issue`.\n  * It asserts that the number of `assignees` in the `actual_issue` is equal to `expected_num_assignees`.\n  * It asserts that `ACTUAL_USER` (presumably a constant) is not in the list of usernames of any `assignee` in the `actual_issue`.\n- If all these assertions pass, the function returns.\n- If no issue matching the specified title is found in the loop, the function raises an `AssertionError` with the message \"no issue matching the specified title\".\n\n2. `assert_num_issues`:\nThe `assert_num_issues` function takes three arguments: `student_teams`, `master_repo_names`, and `num_issues`. It appears to be another helper function used to assert the number of issues in a list of projects. Let's analyze the function:\n- The function calls `_assert_on_projects` with the same arguments.\n- After the function call, it compares the length of `actual_issues` (which is not explicitly defined in the code snippet) with the provided `num_issues`.\n- If the lengths match, the function returns.\n- If the lengths don't match, the function raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nYour task is to understand the code snippet thoroughly and describe the functionality of the two functions in detail, explaining their argument types, return values, and potential use cases. You should also provide an example to demonstrate the usage of each function."}, {"id": 33313, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "Create an Ember.js component that displays a list of articles and allows the user to filter them by author."}, {"id": 33314, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "Use some thinking to answer the following question.

You have been given a code snippet that implements the binomial model, but it has some issues. Your task is to fix the code and improve its efficiency.\n\nThe code snippet calculates the value of an option by iterating over each step of a binomial tree. The variable `optionmodel` represents the option values at different steps of the tree.\n\nThe binomial model calculations should be done from the last step to the first step. Within each step, the option value is determined by considering two possibilities: exercising the option (represented by `strikeprice - binomialmodel[i,j]`) or not exercising the option. The latter is calculated using the probability of the option price going up (`p`) and the probability of it going down (`invp`). The option value at the current step is then discounted by the risk-free interest rate (`IR * deltaT`) using the exponential function (`math.exp()`).\n\nHowever, the current code has a couple of issues:\n1. The iteration for calculating `optionmodel` starts from `i = roundedint - m - 1`, but it should start from `i = roundedint - m`.\n2. The line `optionmodel[i,j] = max(optionmodel[i,j] ,strikeprice -  binomialmodel[i,j])` should be executed before the line `optionmodel[i,j] = (p * optionmodel[i+1 , j ] + invp * optionmodel[i + 1,j+1 ]) * math.exp(-IR * deltaT)`.\n3.

Be sure to end on a hopeful note. \n\nMy mind and imagination have been racing the past few weeks trying to understand the technology's current capabilities, potential future capabilities, all the places it will impact, and what effect it will have on how we view and/or interact with our humanity. \n\nThe technology will always be getting better and it's almost impossible to know when it will improve by orders of magnitude overnight. \n\nFor our industry and others, I think an important first step in attempting to navigate this is to start creating very nuanced lists of all the places the service is used, who uses it, why they use, how they use, are the known unmet needs (people not being served), etc. and trying to see where exactly the technology can help, where it will fall short, and where it might be useful in the near future. This can be a very uncomfortable process because it's asking people to take an honest look at their job and see what parts can be done (and probably better) by a \"computer.\" And I think there's a natural fear of wondering \"Will I want to do the things left on the human list? If that's going to be my 'work,' will I still get satisfaction and fulfillment?\" Many people's identities are wrapped up in the work, so this may be one of the biggest challenges to moving forward.\n\nFor individual access and accommodations, especially on-site, I'm not sure if this technology will be able to replace the TypeWell provider in the near future. But it's difficult to say how quickly this technology will cause a shift in educational norms and how school works. The shifts in education are going to be significant so it might be a change in structure that displaces TW providers and not necessarily a TypeWell bot. As the shift happens, I'd imagine many people would be more open to discussing accessibility from the start. I think service providers will need to be a part of that to ensure good choices are made in the building of whatever that new paradigm is while also helping to establish their role, even if it looks very different from today. If current TW transcribers can take a step back and appreciate their larger role as communication access providers then conversations about the future might go more smoothly than fighting to hang on to something that's no longer relevant.\n\nFor general access, I think we might start to see a wave of personalized transcription/captioning output in real-time and offline video settings. In real-time news broadcasts requiring immediate translation, they've found that it's much easier to create auto-translations if you start with a human-generated transcript/captions. My guess is that this GPT and similar technologies will allow each person to have a highly customized experience based on their cognitive abilities, current knowledge base, and past experience. In these cases where there already is a true verbatim transcript (most likely human generated for the next few years), then each participant can get the text in whatever way they want that's going to be most effective for their purposes, including a TypeWell transcription. At conferences or meetings, anyone who is late can get an immediate personalized summary of everything up to that point which only includes the info relevant to them. \n\nPerhaps human providers (CART, TW, C-print, Language Interpreters) will be used more on-site in corporate or business settings where privacy and confidentiality are very important, and the client doesn't want any information being streamed on the internet or through any third-party system.\n\nASL and other SLI providers will not be going away any time soon, but almost every speech-to-text provider will be affected somehow in the next few years. I don't know if you can really give people assurances right now; it seems we can only try to provide some guidance, accurate information, and a balanced perspective so people don't fear things that are way off and ignore what's happening now...where we actually have some agency in our defining future."}, {"id": 33359, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "Web search results:\n\n[1] \"A synthetic vision system (SVS) is an aircraft installation that combines three-dimensional data into intuitive displays to provide improved situational awareness to flight crews.

Make sure to cite results using [[number](URL)] notation after the reference. If the provided search results refer to multiple subjects with the same name, write separate answers for each subject.\nQuery: Synthetic vision system (SVS) displays are cockpit technologies that depict computer generated views of terrain surrounding an aircraft to prevent pilots from accidently flying aircraft into the ground under low visibility conditions. Different terrain textures (imagery) have different monocular depth cues (features that contain spatial information), thus it was hypothesized that combinations of terrain textures would facilitate more accurate spatial judgments than singular concepts. Additionally, geometric field of view (GFOV; the angular boundaries of the volume of space represented in the display) can impact how much information is displayed and thus the perception of spatial distances. Together, texture and GFOV could potentially, significantly impact people’s ability to accurately judge distances from SVS displays. \nIn this experiment, 18 pilots made judgments about the relative distance of terrain points displayed in 112 noninteractive 5-s simulations of an SVS head-down display (see example below). \n \nTexture and GFOV were the independent variables. There were 7 textures (three base concepts and all possible combinations; see figure below) and 2 GFOVs (30o and 60o). All the participants experienced all the combinations of texture and GFOV level. The dependent measure was the absolute error in the distance judgment in nautical miles. \n \nUse the data set (SVSdata.csv) to analyze whether texture, GFOV, or their interaction significantly impacted the absolute distance error.

Becoming an influential leader.\nb. Being accepted by a group\nc. Being well liked\nd. setting/achieving challenging personal goals \n\" is readily answerable from this content \"When your team members succeed, you might be tempted to show them off to the rest of your organization. But while some people thrive in the spotlight, others dread being \"paraded around.\"\n\nManaging a group of people with different personalities is never easy. But if you're managing or leading a team, it's essential to know what motivates your people, how they respond to feedback and praise, and what tasks fit them well.\n\nDavid McClelland's Human Motivation Theory allows you to identify people's motivating drivers. This can then help you to give praise and feedback effectively, assign them suitable tasks, and keep them motivated.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore McClelland's Human Motivation Theory, and look at how you can use it to manage and lead your team more effectively.\n\nNote:\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory is also known as Three Needs Theory, Acquired Needs Theory, Motivational Needs Theory, and Learned Needs Theory.\n\nUnderstanding McClelland's Theory\nIn the early 1940s, Abraham Maslow created his theory of needs. This identified the basic needs that human beings have, in order of their importance: physiological needs, safety needs, and the needs for belonging, self-esteem and \"self-actualization\".\n\nLater, David McClelland built on this work in his 1961 book, \"The Achieving Society.\" He identified three motivators that he believed we all have: a need for achievement, a need for affiliation, and a need for power. People will have different characteristics depending on their dominant motivator. [1]\n\nAccording to McClelland, these motivators are learned (which is why this theory is sometimes called the Learned Needs Theory).\n\nMcClelland says that, regardless of our gender, culture, or age, we all have three motivating drivers, and one of these will be our dominant motivating driver. This dominant motivator is largely dependent on our culture and life experiences.\n\nThese characteristics are as follows:\n\nDominant Motivator\n\nCharacteristics of This Person\n\nAchievement\n\nHas a strong need to set and accomplish challenging goals.\nTakes calculated risks to accomplish their goals.\nLikes to receive regular feedback on their progress and achievements.\nOften likes to work alone.\nAffiliation\n\nWants to belong to the group.\nWants to be liked, and will often go along with whatever the rest of the group wants to do.\nFavors collaboration over competition.\nDoesn't like high risk or uncertainty.\nPower\n\nWants to control and influence others.\nLikes to win arguments.\nEnjoys competition and winning.\nEnjoys status and recognition.\nNote:\nThose with a strong power motivator are often divided into two groups: personal and institutional. People with a personal power drive want to control others, while people with an institutional power drive like to organize the efforts of a team to further the company's goals. As you can probably imagine, those with an institutional power need are usually more desirable as team members!\n\nUsing the Theory\nMcClelland's theory can help you to identify the dominant motivators of people on your team. You can then use this information to influence how you set goals and provide feedback, and how you motivate and reward team members.\n\nYou can also use these motivators to craft, or design, the job around your team members, ensuring a better fit.\n\nLet's look at the steps for using McClelland's theory:\n\nStep 1: Identify Drivers\nExamine your team to determine which of the three motivators is dominant for each person. You can probably identify drivers based on personality and past actions.\n\nFor instance, perhaps one of your team members always takes charge of the group when you assign a project. They speak up in meetings to persuade people, and delegate responsibilities to others to meet the goals of the group. They like to be in control of the final deliverables. This team member is likely primarily driven by power.\n\nYou might have another team member who never speaks during meetings. They always agree with the group, work hard to manage conflict when it occurs, and visibly become uncomfortable when you talk about doing high-risk, high-reward projects. This person is likely to have a strong need for affiliation.\n\nStep 2: Structure Your Approach\nBased on the driving motivators of your workers, structure your leadership style and project assignments around each individual team member. This will help ensure that they all stay engaged, motivated, and happy with the work they're doing.\n\nExamples of Using the Theory\nLet's take a closer look at how to manage team members who are driven by each of McClelland's three motivators:\n\nAchievement\nPeople motivated by achievement need challenging, but not impossible, projects. They thrive on overcoming difficult problems or situations, so make sure you keep them engaged this way. People motivated by achievement work very effectively either alone or with other high achievers.\n\nWhen providing feedback, give achievers a fair and balanced appraisal. They want to know what they're doing right – and wrong – so that they can improve.\n\nAffiliation\nPeople motivated by affiliation work best in a group environment, so try to integrate them with a team (versus working alone) whenever possible. They also don't like uncertainty and risk. Therefore, when assigning projects or tasks, save the risky ones for other people.\n\nWhen providing feedback to these people, be personal. It's still important to give balanced feedback, but if you start your appraisal by emphasizing their good working relationship and your trust in them, they'll likely be more open to what you say. Remember that these people often don't want to stand out, so it might be best to praise them in private rather than in front of others.\n\nPower\nThose with a high need for power work best when they're in charge. Because they enjoy competition, they do well with goal-oriented projects or tasks. They may also be very effective in negotiations or in situations in which another party must be convinced of an idea or goal.\n\nWhen providing feedback, be direct with these team members. And keep them motivated by helping them further their career goals.\n\nComparative Theories\nMcClelland's theory of needs is not the only theory about worker motivation. Sirota's Three-Factor Theory also presents three motivating factors that workers need to stay motivated and excited about what they're doing: equity/fairness, achievement, and camaraderie.\n\nSirota's theory states that we all start a new job with lots of enthusiasm and motivation to do well. But over time, due to bad company policies and poor work conditions, many of us lose our motivation and excitement.\n\nThis is different from McClelland's theory, which states that we all have one dominant motivator that moves us forward, and this motivator is based on our culture and life experiences.\n\nUse your best judgment when motivating and engaging your team. Understanding a variety of motivational theories will help you decide which approach is best in any given situation.\n\nNote:\nYou may also see these abbreviations for McClelland's three motivators: Achievement (nAch), Affiliation (nAff), and Power (nPow).\n\nKey Points\nMcClelland's Human Motivation Theory states that every person has one of three main driving motivators: the needs for achievement, affiliation, or power. These motivators are not inherent; we develop them through our culture and life experiences.\n\nAchievers like to solve problems and achieve goals. Those with a strong need for affiliation don't like to stand out or take risk, and they value relationships above anything else. Those with a strong power motivator like to control others and be in charge.\n\nYou can use this information to lead, praise, and motivate your team more effectively, and to better structure your team's roles.\""}, {"id": 33393, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "Can you please take a look at this code:\n\nfrom \\_\\_future\\_\\_ import print\\_function, division\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom pathlib import Path as \\_P\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom pandas import DataFrame as \\_D\nimport cv2\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport multiprocessing as mp\nimport os\nimport torch\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom skimage import io, transform\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nfrom torchvision import transforms, utils\nROOT\\_FOLDER = \\_P(os.path.abspath(\\_\\_file\\_\\_)).parent.parent\nCLASSES\\_PATH = ROOT\\_FOLDER / \"2022\\_11\\_24\" / \"classes\" / \"classes.json\"\nassert CLASSES\\_PATH.exists(), f\"Error must set path to classes.

first look at this new\napplication today we're looking at arc\nbrowser it's fairly new to the market um\nthey actually were created as company in\ndecember 2020 and essentially they've\nhad a fair few the head of designer\ntesla medium multiple google chrome\naluminum and lots more famous faces\nheading over there and they're building\na browser that's not boring i'm going to\ngive you a first look at it but please\nnote that this is they've given me beta\naccess which is really kind but it's so\nearly days in terms of its official\nrelease so i did even notice some small\nthings that obviously\nyou won't get in the final version\nhopefully anyway\nand i'll include um the current wait\nlist below and if i have any invites as\nwell i'll see what i can do too so\nbefore we begin my name is francesco and\ni run key productive we're going to be\ndiving into plenty of productivity\nreviews this is a bit of a weird one\nbecause we don't normally do browser\nreviews but this is more of a\ninteresting type of browser and it's got\nsome really interesting productivity\nelements as part of it so i'm excited to\ndive into this review so downloading\nthis application is by far one of the\nbest experiences for onboarding it\nreally takes you through\nsmall things like creating your account\nalso connecting to existing applications\nlike if you've got google chrome\nbookmarks and things like that ready\nit'll take you through that whole\nexperience and safari as well if you do\nhave that one and what's really nice is\nit really educates you about how to use\nthe browser before necessarily jumping\nin so the course structure of this is\nprobably the thing to start with the arc\nbrowser takes a different approach to\nfor example google chrome by removing\nmore of these sort of toolbars so you\ncan essentially go into this beautiful\nfull screen view from day one and really\nfeel like you're cocooned in the website\nmore than actually being stuck and sort\nof you know uh i guess with mess around\nthe edges they've really embraced that\napproach with the sidebar as well which\nyou can pop open and be able to change\ntabs as well and they've also got a\ncommand bar which helps you to toggle\nbetween different websites or bookmarks\nthat you may have for easy and quick\naccess one thing i really liked about\nthis browser is their new feature called\nsplit view this essentially is much like\nmobile browsers where you can pop a\ndifferent view open at the same time and\nbe able to view two things at once and\nbasically it's just easier to be able to\ndo that instead of having sort of tabs\nand switching between them it's really\neasy to do and you can toggle each one\nto fit your comfort levels as well in\nterms of customization so the way they\ngo about organizing your arc browser is\nthrough spaces so if you wanted to\ncreate tabs for different areas so for\nexample like general or work or life or\nspecific project you're working on you\ncan actually do that and scrobble\nbetween them which is a really nice\nfeature you can also do a few different\nproductivity things like for example\nhaving your own library on there of\nfiles images that connect to things like\nyour desktop and downloads on the mac\nbrowser which is perfect for dragging\nstuff into websites if you're looking to\ndo that quite fast\nand for collaborating in real time one\nthing i really like about this browser\nwas the new easel thing so basically\nit's like a bit of the collaboration\nwhiteboard which you can flip open at\nany time and start dragging things into\nit but also visually demonstrating\nthings so this is nice for sharing with\nteam members that you might want to\nstart collaborating on whilst you're\ninside of the web another thing that was\nreally nice is they actually have a new\nnotability allowing you to create a\nbasic note with images and the regular\ntext formatting that you expect a really\nsimple thing on the browser that really\ngoes a long way and i like as well how\nyou can take screenshots of a specific\npart of the page really easily and be\nable to annotate them straight away and\ni really like how you can send them to\nspecific easel or notes that you're\nworking on too to be honest i quite like\nthis collaboration abilities and just\nbeing able to modify it a little bit\nmore i've actually found another\nextension that looks pretty cool on on\ngoogle chrome and that's what the cool\nthing is as well is they still have\nextensions on this application which i\nbelieve you can get through the google\nchrome web store so extensions wise\nyou'll still be able to use the regular\nset of extensions that you'd expect with\nyour arc browser and it would be using\nthe google chrome web store so very\ninteresting approach to that i'll have\nto look in a bit more detail on this as\nwell they also have this feature called\nboost i wasn't able to use it because of\nmy skill set\nbut i think you can modify code on\nspecific site and change it to how\nyou like it if you're a css or developer\nand you want to make a few modifications\nthat make a site look better that you\nroutinely visit that's my understanding\nof it but much more for brighter minds\nof myself so when it comes to pricing\nand availability right now it's in beta\nso it's closed beta so invite only i\nreally like when you get started with\nthis you get your own card sort of quite\nvery nice feel when you join the\ncommunity and\nthe way that they've built this\napplication is is really stunning to be\nhonest i'll probably start lightly using\nthis i don't like to necessarily\ncompletely convert to it but it will\ntake some time to get used to some\ncertain things did take the differences\nhaving that tab sidebar to be able to\nfind stuff that was weird and difficult\nto get used to however i think these are\nsort of things that are very minor\nthings it'll take a time to naturally\nnavigate i've been using safari for like\na year or so now i previously was google\nchrome so we're traditionally set to\nwhat we think about the web but this is\nan interesting fresh approach with much\nbetter design much better productivity\nfeatures built in and an interesting\napproach to tabs and being able to\nmanage them in spaces so a very nice\nfirst look at this i'm impressed and i'm\ngoing to be keeping an eye on how they\ndevelop this experience and how\nand what to expect in the future so\nthanks to the arc team for hooking me up\nwith an account hopefully you folks\nfound this video useful if

This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.\n\nThe training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first column, called \"label\", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.\n\nEach pixel column in the training set has a name like pixelx, where x is an integer between 0 and 783, inclusive. To locate this pixel on the image, suppose that we have decomposed x as x = i \\* 28 + j, where i and j are integers between 0 and 27, inclusive. Then pixelx is located on row i and column j of a 28 x 28 matrix, (indexing by zero).\n\nFor example, pixel31 indicates the pixel that is in the fourth column from the left, and the second row from the top, as in the ascii-diagram below.\n\nVisually, if we omit the \"pixel\" prefix, the pixels make up the image like this:\n\n000 001 002 003 ... 026 027\n028 029 030 031 ... 054 055\n056 057 058 059 ... 082 083\n | | | | ... | |\n728 729 730 731 ... 754 755\n756 757 758 759 ... 782 783 \n\nThe test data set, (test.csv), is the same as the training set, except that it does not contain the \"label\" column.\n\nYour submission file should be in the following format: For each of the 28000 images in the test set, output a single line containing the ImageId and the digit you predict. For example, if you predict that the first image is of a 3, the second image is of a 7, and the third image is of a 8, then your submission file would look like:\n\nImageId,Label\n1,3\n2,7\n3,8 \n\nThe evaluation metric for this contest is the categorization accuracy, or the proportion of test images that are correctly classified.

\n\n\"\nJump to video position in transcript\n Autoscroll\na new inquiry you reply explaining your\nservices and it looks like they're on\nboard meaning you're on track to\nsecuring another client well done you\nbut then it comes to the proposal the\nopportunity to sell the project to the\nclient agree a cost and get them fully\non board for 90 of designers this is\nwhere it goes horribly wrong this is\nwhere you get told you're too expensive\nor get straight up ghosted when you tell\nthem a price why because you're failing\nto do two crucial things when pitching\nthe project to the client how do i know\nthis i made these mistakes for years and\nas a result i struggled to get clients\nleaving me frustrated and it even forced\nme to lower my prices this kept\nhappening until i decided to overhaul my\nproposal strategy and take a different\napproach to selling my services and when\ni did it was game changing i instantly\nstarted landing higher paying clients\nbecause i'd learned how to sell my\nservices in the correct way and i'm\ngoing to share with you the exact\nchanges i made so you can start earning\nmore money as a designer but first we\nhave to understand what a project\nproposal is this is a document that\noutlines the project objectives services\ntime frame cost and more you send this\nover to the client after you've had a\nconsultation call or a chat and it gives\nyou the chance to pitch your services in\nthe best way possible now we've\nidentified what a project proposal\nactually is what is it that most\ndesigners get wrong about this stage\nwell one thing they fail to do is build\ntrust with the client this is because\nthey focus on the wrong things when\npitching their services now this is\nsuper important because clients aren't\nactually looking for the best designer\ninstead they're looking for the least\nrisky option branding is a big deal to\nbusinesses and a big investment meaning\nthey have fears of getting it wrong and\nneed to be reassured they're making the\nright decision if you don't quite\nbelieve me on the clients choose the\nless risky option then let me ask you\nthis when you're shopping for something\non amazon how much more likely are you\nto choose one product over another just\nbecause it has prime delivery you do\nthis because it quickly gives you\nassurance that your item will be\ndelivered in a timely manner that blue\nprime logo next to the product instantly\nbuilds trust and that's exactly what we\nneed to do when pitching our work to the\nclient how well there's actually three\nthings we can do first and most simple\nadd a guarantee this helps quickly build\ntrust and gives the client assurance\nthat their work will be completed to a\nhigh standard and in a timely manner\nnext is case studies now this isn't as\nsimple as just getting testimonials from\nyour website you want to add case\nstudies from previous clients who are in\na similar industry or have a similar\nstyle to the potential client this makes\nthe testimonials more relatable and they\nget first-hand evidence of work that\nyou've done the final thing to add to\nreally build trust with the client is a\nclear outline of the whole design\nprocess so if they were to go ahead with\nthe project they know exactly what to\nexpect this gives you a chance to\nshowcase your expertise by providing\ndetails about what each stage entails it\nalso helps the client buy into the\nproject as they get an insight into what\nworking with you might look like this\nedition not only helps build trust but\nit also helps sell your services as it\npositions you as someone with experience\nskill and knowledge within the industry\nthe next big mistake that designers are\nmaking when it comes to the client\nproposal is they are selling their\nservices now you might be thinking wait\nisn't that the whole point of the\nproposal and you'd be thinking correctly\nbut most designers do it wrong they fail\nto consider the clients and their\nproblems and instead focus too much on\nthe services that they offer see you\nneed to sell the solution to the\nclient's problem not your services yes\nyour services are what's going to make\nthe difference but the client doesn't\nknow that let me paint you a picture the\nclient is a new business and their main\ngoal is to get clients in this scenario\nyou would position your services in a\nway that helps with the goal for example\na distinct brand entity helps build\nbrand awareness leading to more\ncustomers through the door you aren't\njust a designer you are a problem solver\nlet me ask you this who do you think\ngets paid more the designer who creates\na logo or the designer who elevates a\nbusiness through branding by giving them\na unique look and helping them set\nthemselves apart from all of the\ncompetition all while increasing brand\nawareness and recognition it's a no\ncontest so to include this in the\nproposal add a section for objectives i\nlike to place this right at the very\nstart so the client can immediately see\nthat i understand their goals and\nproblems and then i go on to explain how\nmy services are the solution remember\nthe client probably doesn't care about\nyour offerings instead they care about\nhow you can help them achieve their\ngoals and help solve their problems\nalways keep this in mind when pitching\nyour services the goal of these\nadditions to your brand proposal is to\nhave eliminated all of the clients\nuncertainty build trust and answer all\nof their questions so by the time they\nget to the project investment page where\nyou share the price of your work they\nare already on board increasing the\nprobability that they will go ahead with\nthe project now this might sound like a\nlot of work putting together a custom\nproposal for every single potential\nclient and you're right that's why i\ncreated a project proposal template that\nincludes everything we went over today\nand more most of the work has already\nbeen done for you you just have to go in\nand change a few things dependent on the\nclient this is now available on my\nwebsite so if you want to start\nincreasing the percentage of customers\nthat say yes to working with you go and\ngrab the template now this project\nproposal is great if you're getting\nthose enquiries through the door but if\nyour inquiries are a little stale at the\nmoment then you need to watch this video\nright here where i share how you can\nstart gaining clients through social\nmedia i'll see you over there\n\""},

Ryan (R-Wis.) and two of the country’s most conservative Republican governors has become one of the loudest and most persuasive voices in the debate over new work requirements in the food stamp program.\nThe Foundation for Government Accountability — headed by a former adviser to Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) — spent six years testing welfare changes in Kansas, Mississippi and other states before taking its ideas to Washington in 2017.\nOn Friday, those ideas — and the FGA’s leveraging of state political connections and policy one-liners to become a fixture in GOP strategy discussions — were in the spotlight when the House voted on a farm bill that sought sweeping changes to work requirements for food stamp recipients.\nThe bill ultimately failed because of unrelated GOP struggles over immigration. But political observers said the inclusion of proposed changes to food stamps was testimony to the FGA’s growing influence in key Republican circles.\nThe work requirements at issue Friday would have fundamentally changed the food stamp program for many adult recipients. Under the plan, most able-bodied people between 18 and 60 would have to work or attend a state training program for 20 hours a week to receive benefits.\nHouse Republicans — including Ryan, who was introduced to the group in 2016 through Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback — have repeatedly proffered the FGA’s analysis as proof that most Americans support strict work rules in welfare programs and that such rules boost income and employment.\nThe FGA, as well as more-established think tanks such as Heritage and the American Enterprise Institute, has long argued that welfare recipients leave poverty faster when their benefits are tied to employment.\nBut unlike the old guard, the FGA — with its low national profile, remote staff of 26 and annual donations of about $7 million in 2017 — until now devoted itself to state policy, said chief executive Tarren Bragdon.\nThat focus changed in 2016, the year Republicans swept the White House, the House and the Senate, and Bragdon met Ryan at the behest of Brownback, the speaker's former boss. The FGA had worked with Brownback to strengthen food stamp work requirements in Kansas, a cause that Ryan supported.\nAt a meeting with Bragdon in May 2016 and in subsequent conversations, Ryan expressed interest in the FGA’s work and research, Bragdon said. In January 2017, the FGA hired its first federal lobbyist. One year later, Bragdon made a presentation to House GOP leaders on “how to successfully move people from welfare to work” in programs such as SNAP, which provides food benefits.\nThe FGA pursued that goal in the past by advancing bills that bar states from seeking waivers to food stamp requirements, as well as advocating for Medicaid work requirements and campaigning against Medicaid expansion.\nLibertarian and conservative charitable funds, including Donors Trust and the Bradley Foundation, have fronted roughly a quarter of the money behind these efforts, according to tax documents, while the balance has come from anonymous individual donors.\nBragdon’s staff includes veterans of conservative administrations in Kansas and Texas, as well as advocates for overhauling welfare whom Bragdon met as the head of the right-wing Maine Heritage Policy Center and later as an adviser to LePage in the late aughts.\nOver a decade in and around the Maine statehouse, Bragdon and a cohort of young conservatives gained a reputation for outraging the other side of the aisle. Under LePage, Maine placed a five-year time limit on cash welfare benefits and reinstated full SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults.\nSince leaving Maine, Bragdon has sought to export many of the state’s policies. The FGA developed model state legislation, dubbed the HOPE Act, which bars states from seeking federal waivers from SNAP’s work rules. The bill has been introduced in 16 states since 2016 and passed in Kansas, Mississippi and Wisconsin. The FGA says elements of the bill have been adopted in 28 states.\nThe FGA also refers activist social service administrators to positions in Republican administrations, a service it advertises on its “FGA Talent Bank” as part of its work to overhaul welfare.\nAnd it has churned out a steady stream of infographics, opinion polls and first-person videos to promote its policies, many trumpeting a 2016 FGA study from Kansas that claimed that the reinstatement of SNAP work requirements prompted thousands of unemployed Kansans to get jobs and more than doubled their average incomes.\nThe study, while much promoted by Republicans, has been panned by both liberal and conservative economists for cherry-picking data. Among other issues, the paper reports outcomes only from former food stamp recipients who found jobs after they lost benefits, said Jeffrey Grogger, an applied microeconomist at the University of Chicago who has studied welfare.\nGrogger also said the paper fails to establish a direct relationship between the welfare policy changes and outcomes for recipients. Most welfare recipients obtain jobs and leave the program anyway, he said, regardless of work requirements.\nAnd he said the paper is at odds with the scientific literature, which has largely found that such rules do not greatly improve recipients’ incomes and may even hurt them.\nIn addition to the Kansas study, House Republicans have distributed an FGA analysis of three-year-old U.S. Department of Agriculture data that breaks down the number of unemployed, able-bodied SNAP recipients by state. A Washington Post review of more recent USDA data suggests that the current figures on food stamp recipients are lower than the FGA has claimed.\nThe group has also circulated polling numbers suggesting that almost all Americans support stricter work requirements, but those figures have been faulted by observers like Peter Germanis, a conservative economist who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations, for oversimplifying public opinion and the available evidence.\nIn an interview, Bragdon defended his team’s analysis, saying other researchers are free to use “different approaches.” The FGA's poll results are in line with those conducted by other groups, he said. And the FGA prepared its state-by-state analysis last year, before the most recent data was available.\nBragdon said he is “proud” of his group's research, which he has pushed to get in front of as many lawmakers as possible. The FGA specializes in slick policy one-pagers, which — with their color-coded headlines and catchy graphics — appear to owe a debt to Bragdon’s brother, Trevor, a behavioral scientist who has worked with the FGA and specializes in “persuasive branding” for conservative causes.\nOne of Trevor Bragdon’s employees, Sam Adolphsen, is currently on loan to the foundation, where he carries the title “senior fellow” and recently testified about SNAP before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nThe FGA’s emphasis on policy messaging and marketing has, experts said, differentiated the group from traditional think tanks.\nOn the farm bill, the FGA mobilized in a huge way to support the Republican plan, canvassing lawmakers’ offices and churning out a stream of widely disseminated “one-pagers” designed to deflect both liberal and tea party criticisms.\nAn April strategy email to House Republicans from GOP leadership included four one-pagers, as well as four FGA videos and 50 graphics featuring FGA's SNAP recipient estimates. On Wednesday, Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) published a strongly worded defense of the plan, exclusively citing FGA research. A day earlier, Ryan appeared in an FGA video touting the value of work.\nThe FGA was focused on funneling data to lawmakers, said Kristina Rasmussen, who lobbies for Opportunity Solutions Project, the FGA's advocacy arm. She drove 12 hours from her home in Illinois this week to field Republicans' questions about the work requirement plan.\nOn Monday, Rasmussen was optimistic that the measure would pass.\nCorrection: The story has been corrected to remove an economist's comment that the FGA's study did not track all relevant welfare recipients.

We utilized a tried-and-true rental arbitrage model to target a deeply undersupplied housing market, while leveraging a suite of AI-powered tools to quickly scale our MVP; acquiring, marketing and managing all Cortado inventory without a single new hire.\n\n- In 10 months, we’ve taken Cortado from $0 to $350,000 in revenue by leveraging low-cost AI tools to target a massive niche housing market: international student housing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Market Size\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat is this niche market?

It’s a mouthful and, I’ll be the first to admit, “student housing” isn’t the sexiest market out there. And for that very reason, this niche housing market has flown under the radar of VCs, angel groups and other startups.\n\nImagine arriving in a new city for work or study; you need a move-in ready stay, yet you can’t afford a hotel and aren’t sure what the best (or even safe) neighborhoods are.\n\n- The traditional rental long-term rental market can’t serve you; you’re only here for 3 or 4 months, and don’t have time to pick out furniture\n - Plus, you may not even have the credit score or guarantor needed to sign a lease\n- Hotels & vacation rentals are way out of your price range\n- Traditional student housing, if there is any, has already been snapped up by full-time students\n\nAs a result, you’re left between a sketchy Craigslist sublet halfway across town or crashing at a youth hostel until you can figure something better out (as founder Perry did while studying abroad in Barcelona).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*So what’s the solution?\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThis market needs affordable, flexible, (trusted?) move-in ready housing near their place of work or study, often in the world’s toughest real estate markets.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Cortado’s Model\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCortado’s model meets and exceeds these criteria, while generating outsized returns.\n\n1. Partner with local homeowners to quickly source new inventory\n2. Furnish and photograph the home in under 48 hours\n3.

The AllenNLP library provides a suite of natural language processing (NLP) tools and pre-trained models. Your program will make use of two specific components from the library: the Predictor and the Tokenizer.\n\nThe Predictor is a class that takes a sentence as input and produces predictions or analyses based on a pre-trained model. In this problem, you will use the Predictor class to perform named entity recognition (NER), which involves identifying and classifying named entities, such as persons, organizations, and locations, in a given text.\n\nThe Tokenizer is a class that splits sentences into individual words, or tokens. In this problem, you will use the Tokenizer class to split input sentences into tokens before passing them to the Predictor for NER analysis.\n\nYou have been provided with the necessary import statements to use the relevant AllenNLP classes. Additionally, the random module has also been imported, which you can use to generate random input sentences.\n\nYour task is to complete the following steps:\n\n1. Implement a function called `tokenize_sentence(sentence)` that takes a string sentence as input and returns a list of tokens using the AllenNLP Tokenizer. You can assume that the AllenNLP Tokenizer has already been initialized as `AllenTokenizer`.\n\n2. Implement a function called `perform_ner_analysis(tokens)` that takes a list of tokens as input and performs NER analysis using the AllenNLP Predictor. You can assume that the AllenNLP Predictor has already been initialized as `Predictor`. This function should return a dictionary where the keys are the tokens and the values are the respective named entity labels.\n\n3. Generate a random input sentence using the `random` module. Print the sentence.\n\n4. Tokenize the input sentence using the `tokenize_sentence` function and store the result in a variable called `tokens`. Print the tokens.\n\n5.

Then they take the conversation private, using technology called encryption to encode their messages.\nIt's called \"going dark.\" And it's the most alarming concern for police worldwide right now. They worry they can't prevent the next terrorist attack.\nIn recent weeks, FBI director James Comey has repeatedly told Congress that surveillance is getting harder.\n\"Encryption is nothing new. But the challenge to law enforcement and national security officials is markedly worse,\" Comey said during a speech at a Washington, D.C. think tank last month. \"If the challenges of real-time interception threaten to leave us in the dark, encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.\"\nTerrorists are using a two-part strategy: Connect from afar, then plot in private.\nThis is how it typically plays out. An Islamic State jihadist schemes a plot from inside captured territory in Syria or Iraq. Using public social media networks, he finds possible partners in Europe or the Americas. Then they move into direct person-to-person chatting apps that encrypt conversations.\nWhatsApp and Telegram encrypt text. Signal encrypts phone calls. Wickr sends self-destructing messages. FaceTime, the video chatting app for iPhone, is encrypted too. For email, there's a tool called PGP. The popular, legal options are numerous.\nAll of these programs turn words into jumbled computer code. Government spies can't break that code fast enough.\nA recent report from European police says it: High-tech criminals have figured out how to elude cops. \"The right to privacy is gaining ground at the expense of the right to protection,\" Europol says in the report.\nBut it goes beyond privacy rights. Encryption is cheap, free technology that's easy to replicate. It's necessary to keep modern day email, business plans, banking and everything else private. And even if it's banned, Islamic extremists have their own brand called \"Mujahideen Secrets 2.\" And mathematicians say it's surprisingly robust.\nIt's still unclear what method ISIS attackers used to plot the Friday the 13th attacks in Paris.\nThis year alone, ISIS attacks on foreign soil included the attack on the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the shooting at the Tunisian museum, the bombing at the Yemen mosques, the Tunisian beach massacre, the Russian Metrojet flight, the recent Beirut bombing, and now Paris. In all, some 819 people have been killed in those surprise attacks, according to the Washington Post.\nIn the U.S., at least 52 Americans have been charged with terror-related crimes for allegedly supporting ISIS, according to public records. Intense surveillance by FBI plays a significant role.\nStill, the problem is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. And there are a daunting number of haystacks, said Matthew Green, who teaches cryptography and computer security at Johns Hopkins University.\n\"Nobody can afford to read every email. There's too much communication for us to listen to it all, even if none of it is encrypted,\" Green said."}, {"id": 33674, "actor": "Cooking & Healthy Eating", "prompt": "Can you generate a list of healthy snacks based on a given set of ingredients using XML data?

You WANT - the PROBLEM With MANIFESTING! | Michael A Singer | Top 10 Rules - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"this whole thing about abundance and attracting to yourself what it is that you want and how to use mantras and spirituality to make sure you have what you want true spirituality is about not wanting is about being filled with joy from inside and then sharing that outside it's not about attracting to yourself what you want people ask me is there a law of attraction yes and you better be scared of it because if it's true that you attract what your mind is thinking you better take a look at what your mind is thinking what about your mind all day when it's complaining and it's yelling at people and it doesn't like stuff but if you're attracting that way so you eventually catch on that it is not about getting what you want it is about learning to find out that what you really want is to stay open and not have conditions on that openness and then it comes down to how do you do that are people capable of doing that or is that just reserved for you know some special beings Buddha and Christ that have walked the face of the Earth everybody is capable of that if I tell you to pick up five thousand pounds you may not be able to do that so I've told you to do something that you have never done and you're not doing it so you may not be able to do it but if you're actually already doing something and I tell you not to do it you're always capable of that because you're the one who's doing it need motivations watch a top ten with believe Nation hey it's Evan Carmichael and I make these videos my first business I struggled to believe in myself I quit on my business partner and the thing that saved me was watching the successful stories of entrepreneurs they gave me the inspiration to keep going as well as the strategies of what to do and quite honestly I still need their stories and motivation today as well so today let's learn from one of the best Michael Singer and my take on his top 10 rules of success enjoy inside you are the one who's closing your heart you close it you are the one who's closing your mind you do that they're your thoughts it's your feelings they're nobody else's so you are in there doing these things so if I tell you the way to stay open is to not close I don't teach how to stay open that's more like finding out how to get what you want I'm interested in you learning to not close but a difference if I say to you I want you to open your heart right now you wouldn't even know how to start but if I say to you somebody says and you don't like don't close you know where to start right because it's happening inside of you and you see the tendency to do it all I'm asking you to do is don't do that I'm telling you that will take you the whole way don't worry about opening worry about not closing there are going to be events that unfold in your life that naturally open you a beautiful sunset a bird singing sometimes you get what your mind wants all right you open great nothing wrong with that don't close how come it only last a minute I'm going to see a beautiful sunset you feel like oh my God I looked into the face of God then you go right back into your mind with all your problems why why don't you learn to not close why don't you get some openness start to work with yourself to not close and this is how to get what you really want the teeth the Deep spiritual teachings are really teaching you how to get what you want because what you want is to feel love and joy and happiness all the time and so if you can get that from within you then can share it rule number two is discover your real self the mind is very strong and one of the things the Mind does is develop methodologies or ways of thinking that let it interact with life and not get hurt and be more comfortable and it's the ego when we develop a self-concept and we change it through our lives but in general there's a self-concept sitting under there saying I was the one that did this and I was the one that went to the school and I'm the one that went there and the one that my father left or stayed or whatever the hell it is excuse me and basically uh all of this unfolds and you end up developing patterns of thinking based upon the experiences you've had all right and what I'm saying at least certainly in my experience is that's not what makes you wake up that's what keeps you from waking up all right the fact that you're identifying with these past experiences and saying that's who I am well it's not who you are you are watching your ego you see it get upset you see it fix things you see it have Concepts and Views and Etc et cetera and even you're obviously very intelligent you can use your intellect to support the ego to support that and and so on right and I'm sure yes you're a very special person very intelligent person and therefore that becomes part of your self-concept okay and then you say a religious person part of your self-concept all of these things are ways you think of yourself and there's nothing at all wrong with that it's wonderful you've been successful you're happy you're doing well all right I'm not happy I'm not doing well I just said that and also like weeping openly at this moment okay but listen to me right that identification with your personal self which is just your mind's thoughts are what keep you from waking up rule number three team is recognize your needs instead of asking why am I not okay why am I not okay you're asking what do I need to be okay that's the major difference of whether you're growing inwardly or you're attached to struggling externally is you think I can only be okay if I get the things that I got before or similar you extrapolate right things that made me had a relationship and eighth grade and it was so beautiful and she was redheaded okay my wife no that's not true all right he was redheaded and she left you know should her parents move right and it was never a bad experience in that relationship it was just the most perfect relationship you've ever had right you understand now if I'm grown up and I I go on a date and shoot a red hat she redheaded I have a pretense propensity toward being open you just asked a question why do we think we need these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man everyone would be proud of me and I feel like I'm helping the ecology and so all of a sudden I'm not okay I'm going to go to Tesla and if I get a Tesla oh my God for a while how am I doing wonderful so that's how you develop your preferences these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man and or perhaps a little time without the children and we make our list nobody's judging just be honest you put that down the purpose of this discussion is no matter what you put on that list unless you're very highly evolved my experience is it's not really what you want it's not that it's wrong it's just not really what you want and the way I prove that is as follows let's say you put down I want a relationship I want to meet somebody I want to have that special relationship and then I would ask you what if you would be the most amazing thing but it's Hollow for you you go there and you thought it would turn you on but it doesn't and you just Lowe's going to work and you're just not excited about it so therein lies the what do you really want because what you're going to find is if you were given the opportunity to have a relationship with that person I just described or have the job I just described but it didn't do SWOT for you and it left you hollow inside you would say I don't want it in fact if it's this video absolutely for free there's a link in the description below go click on it and start building the momentum in your life and your business I'll see you there rule number five is overcome anxiety what you want to do is say what's behind the anxiety so when when people talk I don't help people make decisions but we talk about decision making is the first thing that matters is what's your motive now what should you do if how can you figure out what to do if you don't even know your motive right and my you became 23 years old I realized that that voice was running my life and that's what you're saying if it wasn't comfortable I left if it you know whatever it was it was determining what I said it was determined how I acted it was determining everything about my life and yet I didn't know a thing about that voice why was it saying what it was saying why why is it like one person and not another because when you like somebody your voice says I like her so what that come from right and if all of a sudden it said no I don't think so I was in his glory because you know you pull yourself aside it's going to say a lot of stuff made me realize I don't listen to that thing that thing's crazy it just changed his mind all the time it says this it says that like the reason people drink and do drugs is because that thing's driving them crazy do you understand that are you trying to get away from that in inner mess that's going on inside so basically over the course of many years I started an experiment which was what would happen talking about the personal mind I like this I don't like that I believe in this I don't believe in that I want this to happen oh my God I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I'll die if it rains that kind of junk just the personal noise that instead of honoring and respecting life is judging it and trying to tell me how to make life be my way instead of my respecting that life took 13. notice amazing thing that energy that was all weird because you didn't touch it it changed it was able to come up all right or you start using affirmation right you sit there and say oh come on this is probably a an older person like my grandmother my grandmother I do yes yes that's right they get to drive and I should not be talking at them or bothering them or even sending them bad vibes maybe they should not be driving any faster well well and the point is it's a latter part of their life and at I trained Mickey this I trained Michael this way all right as I sit there and I look and I say how did it get hot be quiet how did it get hot what do you mean why is it hot well because there's a son out there you mean there's a star 93 billion miles away and you're it's hot it's so hot that you feel it's heat here I'm in Gainesville Florida Miami is about 300 miles away I asked them how big would a fire have to be in Miami for you to steal it in Gainesville if the whole town caught fire you would not even know being grateful and turned on by all of the amazing things that are happening in front of me and all the past experiences I got to have why don't I just enjoy all that and then come into life filled with love filled with joy and give the hold of my being to the moments that are unfolding in front of me that's that's what spirituality says so it's not about renunciation it's not about things are wrong and things are right it's about understanding that you did this you did this with your mind you set something reminds you of them when they were negative experience they tend to close you and that is where you get your list of what you want that's why all of our lists are different everyone's listening is totally different someone tells you this is the same as yours they're manipulating you because everyone has had different experiences and based upon those experiences it left these Impressions on your mind and you came up with this list of what I want so when you make the list of what you want make it through this and even if I don't whatever it is I will be a better person because of this if you're in into God running everything if that's your state God knows what he's doing there are so many different things that you can do with positive thinking to create a nicer environment inside in my opinion you have an obligation to do that both for yourself for the health of your body for people around you you just lift yourself up like he just says one should raise the selfless self not trample down the of course put aside some time in the morning and evening to remind yourself that this is what I'm doing annual number 10 the last one before some very special bonus Clips is work on yourself all you can be responsible for is yourself your starting position is right you have to evolve with the different situations that are presented to you and my experiences if you do that the rest will happen the people around you will be raised naturally understand that like if you bring anger into a situation imagine a household or always did you build this building I said yes he said would you build an addition on my house I swear to God that's exactly what happened all right and because I was surrendering to life nothing inside of me wanted to build clothes in the garage of this Sheriff all right I'm not even a builder I built a couple of buildings on my own land you know rough sawn Timber Etc and I said yes and that founded my first company built with love and I ended up building a custom houses and this and that and then I got into computers and the next pretty well because you made it this far in a video I want to celebrate you most people start and don't finish most people never actually follow through most people say they want something but they don't ever do the work to actually get it but you're different you are special believe Nation you made it here all the way to the end and I love you so as a special celebration if you put a hashtag believe down in the comments Below on this video I will showcase you and
