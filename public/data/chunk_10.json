To use this model, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt, or use the /settings command and select 5️⃣ MJ Version 5 This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like repeating patterns with --tile\n\nPrompt: vibrant California poppies --v 5\n\nPrompt: high contrast surreal collage --v 5\n\nCurrent Model The Midjourney V4 model is an entirely new codebase and brand-new AI architecture designed by Midjourney and trained on the new Midjourney AI supercluster. The latest Midjourney model has more knowledge of creatures, places, objects, and more. It's much better at getting small details right and can handle complex prompts with multiple characters or objects. The Version 4 model supports advanced functionality like image prompting and multi-prompts. This model has very high Coherency and excels with Image Prompts.\n\nPrompt: vibrant California poppies\n\nPrompt: high contrast surreal collage\n\nVersion 4 Styles 4a, 4b, and 4c Midjourney Model Version 4 has three slightly different \"flavors\" with slight tweaks to the stylistic tuning of the model. Experiment with these versions by adding --style 4a, --style 4b, or --style 4c to the end of a V4 prompt. --v 4 --style 4c is the current default and does not need to be added to the end of a prompt.\n\nNote on Style 4a and 4b\n\n--style 4a and --style 4b only support 1:1, 2:3, and 3:2 aspect ratios. --style 4c support aspect ratios up to 1:2 or 2:1.\n\n--style 4a\n\nvibrant California poppies --style 4a\n\n--style 4b\n\nvibrant California poppies --style 4b\n\n--style 4c\n\nvibrant California poppies --style 4c\n\n--style 4a\n\nschool of fish --style 4a\n\n--style 4b\n\nschool of fish --style 4b\n\n--style 4c\n\nschool of fish --style 4c\n\nPrevious Models You can access earlier midjourney models by using the --version or --v parameter or by using the /settings command and selecting a model version. Different models excel at different types of images. prompt example: /imagine prompt vibrant California poppies --v 1\n\n--version 3\n\ndefault model: 07/22–11/22 highly creative compositions\n\nmoderate coherency\n\n--version 2\n\ndefault model: 04/22–07/22 creative, colorful, and painterly low coherency\n\n--version 1\n\ndefault model: 02/22–04/22 very abstract and painterly low coherency\n\n--hd (high definition)\n\nearly alternative model busy detailed and abstract low coherency\n\nNiji Model The niji model is a collaboration between Midjourney and Spellbrush tuned to produce anime and illustrative styles. The --niji model has vastly more knowledge of anime, anime styles, and anime aesthetics.

Use the /settings command and select Style Med to reset to the default style setting for all --niji prompts. Niji supports multi-prompts or image-prompts.\n\nTest Models Occasionally new models are released temporarily for community testing and feedback. There are currently two available test models: --test and --testp, which can be combined with the --creative parameter for more varied compositions. prompt example: /imagine prompt vibrant California poppies --testp --creative\n\n--test\n\nA general-purpose artistic model with good coherency\n\n--test + --creative\n\n--testp\n\nA photo-realism model with good coherency\n\n--testp + --creative\n\nNotes on current test models --test and --testp\n\nTest models only support --stylize values between 1250–5000. Test models do not support multi-prompts or image-prompts Test models have a maximum aspect ratio of 3:2 or 2:3. Test models only generate two initial grid images when the aspect ratio is 1:1. Test models only generate one initial grid image when the aspect ratio is not 1:1. Words near the front of the prompt may matter more than words near the back.\n\nHow to Switch Models Use the Version or Test Parameter Add --v 1, --v 2, --v 3, --v 4, --v 4 --style 4a, --v4 --style 4b --test, --testp, --test --creative, --testp --creative or --niji to the end of your prompt.\n\nUse the Settings Command Type /settings and select your preferred version from the menu.\n\n1️⃣ MJ Version 1 2️⃣ MJ Version 2 3️⃣ MJ Version 3 4️⃣ MJ Version 4 🌈 Niji Mode 🤖MJ Test 📷 MJ Test Photo\n\nCoherency is the strength of the connection between the text prompt and the resulting image.

Some refer to it as Primal Energy. It is what flows through the patterns of reality and what makes magic possible. The primal force, quintessence can not truly be divided, measured, or contained. The patterns of all supernaturals, mortals, inanimate objects, and the whole of the Tellurian is woven from Quintessence. The term literally translates to \"Fifth Essence\".\n\nPatterns are metaphorical vessels of Quintessence, and as such, constitute all known reality, acting as \"lego bricks\" to Prime's \"building blocks\".\n\nThe way that a mage can alter reality is based on 9 spheres of magic.\n\nThose sphere of magic are:\ncorrespondance, the element of connection between apparently different things.\nCorrespondence magic allows powers such as teleportation, seeing into distant areas, levitation, and flying. At higher levels, the Mage may also co-locate themselves or even stack different spaces within each-other. Correspondence can be combined with almost any other sphere to create effects that span distances. Space, interrelationships and sympathetic links all become clear through the study of Correspondence. By bending space or bypassing it entirely, a mage can travel rapidly, fly or teleport from place to place. Divining locations allows the mage to see far-away places or direct magic over distances. With a link between a person and an object, Effects may be targeted through connecting rituals.\n\nentropy: the principle of chance, fate and mortality.\nEntropy concerns itself mainly with the study of order, chaos, luck, and destiny. From this Sphere comes the study of order and randomness, and thus, the study of totally random creation and destruction. All things dissolve eventually into haphazard components, and similar events form from disjointed, unconnected patterns. Mages who study Entropy often choose the path of either order or chaos. Students of order look into patterns, into the ways that events flow from one to the next and into the means by which new things build on the old. Students of chaos study the dissolution of patterns, the destruction of matter and the random elements that infect happenstance and probability.\n\nforces: the understanding of elemental energies.\nForces is the Sphere of energetic Patterns, among them heat, light, vibration, radiation and gravity. In effect, Forces are constructs of Quintessence in motion. Every force has its own unique properties, but they all share the common root of Prime swirling through a Pattern. Although modern physics disputes the old lines between matter and energy, the venerable study of Forces transcends human politics. Science considers certain forces to be the absence of others, while mystical Traditions usually consider negative and positive forces (like heat and cold) to be opposite but independent entities.\n\nlife: The mysteries of life and death.\nLife governs those Patterns that grow, evolve and eventually change. Life patterns differ from the other two static Spheres in that they are not self-contained vessels of Quintessence, but draw on the Tellurian for sustenance and later return these energies. This process only ends when Life transforms into Matter, during the moment of death. As a whole, this Sphere embraces everything that has living cells within itself, even if that object is technically dead. Preserved blood and organs, still-living plants, live-culture cheese, and so forth contain Life, but corpses, cotton fibers, withered organs, or cut wood become Matter.\n\nmatter: The principles behind supposedly “inanimate” objects.\nMatter is the Pattern Sphere that purviews all inorganic Patterns that hold Quintessence, in contrast to the energetic Patterns of Forces and the symbiotic Patterns of Life. Representing the base of the physical world, Matter governs the elements from the periodic table in all their physical conditions (or, to mystics, the three elements of Earth, Air and Water). Manipulating Matter is usually a much simpler affair than manipulating other Patterns.\n\nmind: The potentials of consciousness.\nSince human beings perceive reality through a complex interplay of consciousness, the Mind Sphere affects how a being sees the world around it. Such study leads to the investigation of thought, the existence of perfect forms, the idea of intelligence, and inquiry divorced from mere physical form.\nThe Mind mage can use thought to communicate, control, and wipe away the inaccuracies and errors of human misjudgment for the peaceful serenity of total concentration. All thought is open to the mage: From the refined sensibilities of human philosophy to the feral instincts of animals. Any thinking process can be comprehended and manipulated with sufficient skill.\n\nprime: An understanding of the Primal Energy within all things.\nPrime is the Sphere of magic that governs the raw energy of reality, sometimes called Primal Energy, Quintessence or Odyllic Force. A mage who uses Prime can sense magic of other magi, use the power of the universe to create effects out of nothingness, and can store Quintessence past their Avatar background rating. It is the study of Quintessence, and it is regarded by all the Traditions as a valuable or even holy power. With Prime, magi can create, destroy or reshape the universal energies. A mage can further enchant objects and living creatures with magical energy, fight back the effects of Paradox, use countermagic, and make the changes they exact on the world permanent.\nWhile other Spheres influence the actual stuff of reality, Prime controls the power from which they all spring. Prime moves through the Patterns of Life, Matter, Spirit and Forces, animating them only to be released again when these Patterns expire. It is a cyclic expression of magic itself.\n\nspirit: Comprehension of Otherworldly forces and inhabitants.\nSpirit is the Sphere of the ephemeral stuff that is the building block of the three Umbrae, the realms between the pureness of unbridled Prime and the Patterned World of flesh. Spirit is a homogeneous whole, a sort of conceptual energy given a special form that can mirror or mimic the more mundane Patterns of elements. However, Spirit is much more. It's also the results of emotion, hope, and thought -- the intangible end product of the Mind's musing and shaping. The mage skilled in Spirit can touch the wall that separates potential from material to see beyond.\nSpirit is also needed to communicate or suborn Spirits, the inhabitants of these strange realms. These entities are bound by strange rules and customs mage would do very well to learn, and they can be powerful allies or relentless foes.\n\ntime: The strange workings of chronological forces and perceptions.\nTime is known as the magic that all men know. Science and magic both agree that the flow of time varies with the observer, that time itself is hardly the constant that it initially seems. Esoteric doctrines claim time is an illusion. Even those who accept Time is forward march (more or less) still discover that the eddies, currents and branching paths of time are far more manifold and mutable than most people would ever guess.\nMages studying Time magic agree that the world is full of unexpected whorls and vortices of temporal disturbance. Time contracts around some places and dilates at others, though the regimentation of scientific time means that such phenomena are not as common as they once were. In unusual circumstances, time may loop back on itself, make jumps and rifts to past or future, or diverge in multiple streams.\n\nMoreover each sphere of magic has a level of mastery attached to it.\nlevel 1: the mage is able to perceive and understand in detail the way in which the topic of the sphere behave.\nlevel 2: the mage can manipulate in a minor way the topic of the sphere. He can also alter itself a bit.\nlevel 3: the mage is able to controle the topic of the sphere. At this level the mage is able to damage itself of others with his magic.\nlevel 4: the same as for level 3 but in a bigger scale (the size of a human for exemple).\nlevel 5: the mage totally master the topic of the sphere and is able to produce effect far greater in intensity and size.\n\nKnowing all this, what sphere and level would a mage need to put someone to sleep ?"}, {"id": 1596, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "Can you provide me a holiday itinerary for a trip to Sri Lanka that is suitable for adolescents and adults.
