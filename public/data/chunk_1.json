Answer according to: MY TWINKLEBEAR: I’m constantly telling her how beautiful she truly is. Compliments are one of the most extraordinary components of social life. If given right they create so much positive energy that they makes things happen as if by magic. They ease the atmosphere around two people and kindly dispose people to each other. Compliments derive from taking notice of praiseworthy situations…so they are a mark of awareness and consciousness. Once praiseworthy situations are noticed, the awareness needs to be spoken. Compliments are little gifts of love. They are not asked for or demanded. They are powerful gifts. But compliments only work if they are a sincere reflection of what we think, and if they are freely given and not coerced. Compliments backfire if they are not genuine. And faux flattery is usually highly transparent. A false compliment makes the speaker untrustworthy; It raises suspicions about motives. And that can undermine a whole relationship. My Twin Flame, “Twinklebear” Lesley Maclean and I had an interesting discussion today, as we always do. Our talks are engaging, fascinating, and enlightening. They serve as a limelight, on ourselves, as they teach us about ourselves—as this is a featured attribute of the Twin Flame relationship. These gratuitous compliments, definitely fell into the “transparent in motive” category, engendering suspicion and irritation in Twinklebear. Twinklebear describes her reaction to this over the top behavior, as having the reverse effect of what the man desired. She felt the need for more space, the more the man engaged in this type of behavior. Exacerbating Twinklebear’s annoyance, was the man’s disturbing cloying habit of always wanting to “cuddle” with her, seeking reciprocal behavior from Twinks 24/7. Sure, women are famous for craving cuddling, but not all the time. She was hardworking with a job, and a child. She sometimes needed normal “breathing space” after a hard day. So, what does a person do when he or she “needs space?” She withdraws. And so she did. A completely normal reaction. The man’s inability to recognize Twinklebear’s need for normal space, resulted in a loss of respect Twinkelebear had for the man. In every relationship, there is usually a “stronger partner.” In Twinks’ relationship with this other man, she was the stronger partner. In this relationship, the man’s cloying “O.T.T.” compliments, were a symptom of the man’s relative weakness–causing Twinklebear to lose respect for him, and to withdraw from him. This is Primal Males and Females 101. These primal instincts are hardwired into males and females since time immemorial. There should be no surprise in Twinklebear’s reaction to the situation. Her reaction was written in stone, since Neanderthal times. Twinklebear described another relationship, which was on the other end of the spectrum. This other man was such a self absorbed narcissist, that he never complimented Twinklebear—which is hard to believe—if you have eyes and can see what a classic blonde hottie Twinklebear is. This man was incapable of giving, or reciprocating love—acts which would have reached beyond the man’s meager view of himself. However, this other man did not reveal his true nature until much later–when it was too late. This man was also a classic “gaslighter,” a control freak who seemed to need to augment his ego, by subjugating another person’s ego and will. This man was not merely cloyingly and annoying, he was….suffocatingly toxic. Between one man to the other, Twinklebear bounced unknowingly, from one extreme end of the spectrum to the other. These represented meaningless compliments because of their O.T.T. nature—to none. That brings us to Twinklebear and me. With an eye on “compliments,” you have to know that I tell Twinklebear, how beautiful she is, several times day. If I told you that I tell Twinklebear how beautiful she is, perhaps ten to twenty times a day? Would you believe me? Would you think it disingenuous, or untrue? Here’s the thing…. Twinklebear and I think this is totally normal—for us—because these compliments are heartfelt and are acts of compulsion. I face a dilemma here. In order for me to be able to convey what I feel, when I am so overwhelmed by Twinklebear’s physical attributes, then I would no doubt innocently meander into what many would consider—excessiveley explicit detail. But Twinklebear said to me earlier…. Twinklebear is like Aphrodite, the Goddess of love and beauty. With no exaggeration, I see Twinklebear as the most incredibly alluring female in the universe, as compelling as the Greek Goddess, Aphrodite—the goddess of love and beauty. With her classic features and sinfully alluring body (pardon me for salivating here), my God–she is so hot! Aphrodite who? If women re analogous to culinary fare—sweet Twinklebear is the crowning dessert—the delectable cream of the crop, the very pinnacle of primal femininity. But you knew that we being Twin Flames, that our attraction and perception to and of each other, transcends the superficiality of beauty of face and body. There is the element of us seeing deeply into each other, knowing and loving the beauty and familiarity within—the love and familiarity borne of living past lives together as Twin Flame loves. Reincarnated Twin Flames we may be, and the more profound turn-on being what it is because of this—don’t forget that we are also human. As humans who are susceptible to the physical charms of the other, hey—how could I not tell her twenty times a day…. To say that these are “compliments,” is to cheapen and dilute their meaning. Rather, these proclamations of love and heartfelt, emotionally driven proclamations are…. Ahh! What a wonderful memoir. I love you! I think age, had lots to do with it too. When younger, we tend to be swept away with romantic ideals, and so on. .. so now I know what’s genuine. That my dearest sookybear,is you! I know you mean it. You are so kind. Awww..my sweet Twinklebear, yes, you are right. Age does teach us valuable lessons—sometimes the hard way. Now I know what REAL love is also. I’ve never known anything like it.

Last Sunday, I had a wonderful sundate with my in-laws together with my hubby. It was like a post Valentine date for all of us. We had lunch in Seaside Market (or mostly known as Dampa) along Macapagal Avenue in Pasay City. Many waiters approached and called our attention as we passed by each restaurant (if you've been there, you know what I meant of this usual scenario) but we still chose to eat in the restaurant where we had eaten before because it is more spacious there. Oh we really enjoyed the quick buying of fresh sea foods from the market stalls right across the restaurant, did some bargaining and of course, the sumptuous lunch of fresh cooked sea foods! When it was cooked and finally served all in the table, we were surprised because there are so many that we all struggle to finish what we ordered. Haha! If you are my follower on Instagram and Twitter, then you must have seen the photo I posted using the front camera of my iPhone but yeah, I know the photo didn't give much justice on what I was claiming of no make-up look. So, lovelies, here was my look. I set Sunday for my skin to breathe. So I care less for my face and focus more of my attention to chit chat with my in-laws last Sunday. I skipped foundation and just apply loose powder especially when I learned that we will spend some time in MOA after lunch. I don't know if it just me but sea breeze makes my face more oily and sticky feel. I really hate it! So I made sure I'll be less conscious of my face that day. I rocked a no make-up look and for me not to get bothered of reapplying blush, AVON lip & cheek tint saved me and kept my cheeks blushed like it's been pinched all day. I also opted to apply just a lip liner to keep the whole look as natural as possible. And of course, loads of Shu Uemura mascara! Before I end this post, let me share with you some photos on how my day went. Meet the man behind the lens - my husband. Before we headed home, we were able to hear the Sunday mass. As usual, the people in the church overflowed down the road. There are so many people outside and even across SMX. We just stood by our car and heard the mass from where we parked in front of SMX Convention Center. So, that's it for now. I hope you all had a great weekend, too. I follow you, I follow?? Wow Jenniya! You look so great! you actually look like you're wearing a make-up! Beautiful look!! you are so pretty!!! Lovely pictures! The food looks incredible and that Michael Kors handbag is gorgeous. Such a pretty, natural look. And your hair is amazing!! yum! that meal looks delicious! I've followed you, hope you can follow me back. your skin looks flawlessssss omg your eyebrows look so nicely defined! btw, lovin the lashes! i think i'll give Shu Uemura a try. Hi Nuffnangers! There's a contest until today only! i have yet to try that no make up look, as that is the hardest one to accomplish im too daunted to even apply it. hahaha, oh dear, i love your bag! wheres that from, if you dont mind. (i mean from what shop) i love it! followed you, i hope you follow back! You really do have such a gorgeous look. Plus the food looks delish too! So gorgeous even without make-up! No make-up look for the win talaga! Rest days are super welcome, haha! :)) And yeah I agree with the sea breeze. It makes me feel like my face is as mucky as a fish.

I love Dampa. Whenever we eat ther, we also always have a hard time finishing the food! Haha! We bought a lot in the market and later we realized there's so many food when already served. Haha!
