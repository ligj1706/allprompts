Answer according to: In the spirit of the Lint Center's aim to progress the next generation of National Security with support for well-rounded individuals, we are proud to present the Mid-Year 2012 Scholarship Winner essays to Lint Center affiliates.\nNational Security threats have plagued the United States since our independence from British rule. As a nation, we have discovered ways to ensure the safety of our citizens, freedoms, and democracy. The establishment of myriad intelligence and law enforcement agencies has met the challenges that arise as a result of our democratic growth and development. These agencies have been organized to target and attack national security threats, both foreign and domestic. The public perception of national security threats are often associated with a range of issues, from narcotics smuggling, weapons, and human trafficking to domestic and foreign terror attacks.\nAs technology advances new threats emerge. Advanced technology has become an increasingly prevalent tool for radical/extremist groups to carry out threats against the US. With the world’s increasing reliance on technology, so too has the US’s reliance on technology for the operation of defense systems, natural resources management, and economic development. Disconcertedly, the heavy reliance on technology makes infrastructure itself susceptible to corruption and terror attacks from radical/extremist organizations. This vector poses a very viable threat to national security, one that requires a specific skill set to develop effective solutions to ongoing threats.\nUntil recently most agencies defended their targeted national security issues independently without much interest in sharing intelligence with the rest of the law enforcement and intelligence community. These agencies run operations targeting these threats independently, meanwhile, other agencies may be conducting identical operations and targeting the same threats. Thus, both agencies are conducting and developing their own intelligence and investigative leads, without sharing this crucial information with the other agency. Bridging these communication gaps will help solidify a cohesive investigation to target these threats and the investment in collaborative task forces will better defend the nation from multiple national security threats stemming from radical/extremist groups.\nMost organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, do not solely threaten the US on one front. The Sinaloa Cartel’s illicit schemes encompass multiple national security issues in order to accomplish their overall goals. Though one of the most dangerous cartels in Mexico, they are still not considered a terrorist organization because their motives are financially-based, however, their actions still plague national security. In order to smuggle drugs into the US and secure power within Mexico, the Sinaloa Cartel must traffic humans, narcotics, weapons, and money to and from Mexico. The aforementioned crimes are national security issues investigated independently by numerous agencies from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Border Patrol, ICE Homeland Security Investigations to other state and local Law enforcement agencies. Greater collaborative or joint task forces could help bridge the intelligence and communications gap between agencies, as well as assist with jurisdictional concerns.\nMany agencies also face jurisdictional dilemmas involving the investigation and prosecution of subjects and their illicit activity. With collaborative efforts agencies like the Tucson Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations can better use their unique resources to develop a better intelligence picture which can lead to successful investigations charging subjects on a multi-jurisdictional level. Partnering the Border Patrol with ATF can assist with the investigating and prosecuting of the smuggling of humans and weapons, meanwhile partnering with the FBI can bridge intelligence gaps for potential terror threats.\nThese partnerships can also encourage resource collaboration. The violence and the illicit activity along the southwest border far surpass the rest of the country. However, smaller agencies have not seen an increase in manpower in relation to the rising crime rates. Further, the majority of federal investigative agencies do not have the law enforcement personnel or the intelligence and enforcement resources needed to conduct the most comprehensive investigations. Larger agencies, like the Border Patrol and some State agencies, can provide the necessary resources needed to keep up with the larger more sophisticated organizations. Thus, combining these resources can enhance the ability for all law enforcement agencies to combat national security threats.\nCollaborative or joint task forces are becoming and will be the most proficient way to conduct law enforcement operations in the future. In addition to joint task forces, many agencies within the law enforcement community are establishing a new collaborative effort in intelligence fusions centers. A fusion center’s sole purpose is to share resources and de-conflict amongst partnering agencies. De-confliction conveys to investigative agencies that their investigations are not being pursued by other agencies.\nUltimately, it is the goal of every agency is to ensure that the freedoms, safety, and democracy for all US citizens are preserved and protected against national security threats, and simply, this can be most effectively combatted through the means of collaboration."}, {"id": 32037, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "Can you expand on any recent developments in social programs or initiatives that have been implemented in Offaly and how effective they have been?"}, {"id": 32038, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "You are working on a JavaScript application that utilizes the `createSelector` function from the Redux library. The function is used to create memoized selectors, which are efficient and optimize the process of accessing data from the application's state.\n\nHere are the three variations of the `createSelector` function that you need to understand:\n\n1. `createSelector(selectors: InjectableSelector<State, S1>[], projector: (s1: S1) => Result): MemoizedSelector<State, Result>`\nThis version of the function takes an array of selectors and a projector function. It returns a memoized selector that takes the current state as input and applies the projector function to the selected values. The resulting value is then returned from the selector.\n\n2. `createSelector(selectors: [InjectableSelector<State, S1>, InjectableSelector<State, S2>], projector: (s1: S1, s2: S2) => Result): MemoizedSelector<State, Result>`\nHere, the function accepts an array of two selectors and a projector function that takes the selected values from both selectors and produces the final result.\n\n3. `createSelector<State, Props, S1, S2, Result>(selectors: [InjectableSelectorWithProps<State, Props, S1>, InjectableSelectorWithProps<State, Props, S2>], projector: (s1: S1, s2: S2, props: Props) => Result): MemoizedSelectorWithProps<State, Props, Result>`\nThis version allows the selectors to accept additional props as input. It takes an array of two selectors with props and a projector function that takes the selected values and props to produce the final result.\n\nYour task is to implement a simplified version of the `createSelector` function that supports all three variations.\n\nWrite a JavaScript function `createCustomSelector(selectorsArr, projectorFunc)` that takes an array `selectorsArr` and a function `projectorFunc`. The `selectorsArr` contains one or more selectors, and the `projectorFunc` is the function that will be applied to the selected values.\n\nYou need to return a memoized selector function that behaves according to the variations described above. The returned selector should be able to handle different inputs and produce the expected output based on the number of selectors and the projector function.\n\n**Function Signature:** `function createCustomSelector(selectorsArr: Function[], projectorFunc: Function) => Function`\n\n**Input**\nThe function `createCustomSelector` takes in two parameters:\n- `selectorsArr` (1 <= selectorsArr.length <= 3): An array of selectors, each represented by a function that accepts the application state and returns a selected value. The number of selectors in the array can be 1, 2, or 3.\n- `projectorFunc`: A function that takes the selected values from the selectors and produces the final result.\n\n**Output**\nThe function should return a memoized selector function that takes the current state as input, applies the projector function to the selected values, and returns the final result.\n\n**Note**\n- The memoized selector should only recalculate the result if the input state or any of the selected values change."}, {"id": 32039, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "Reword the following sentence, preserving the same structure and meaning:\nI am very disappointed by your actions."}, {"id": 32040, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "Create a businessplan for startup leasing a dog who can be woman's wing.

Just so we are on the same page about the proclamation let me share with you how the Church about how the message of Jesus about God is Good News for humanity. Here it is that: “Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world” (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, “with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.” As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. “This is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.” This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an “intimate and vital bond of man to God,” so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God.\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Here are at least five reasons why the Gospel might be forgotten, overlooked or even explicitly rejected. I want to know in the comments below if one or more of these attunes might apply to you or may have been your perspective before you believed.\n\nRevolt against evil in the world\nReligious ignorance or indifference\nThe cares and riches of this world\nThe scandal of bad example on the part of believers\nCurrents of thought hostile to religion \nFinally, that attitude of sinful man which makes him hide from God out of fear and flee his call.\n(CCC 29)\n\nLet me know if you are a believer and have ever once identified with one of these six reasons. If you do not believe does one of these six reasons apply to you and if so, which one. Pause, the video and go in the comments and let me know your thoughts. Take a moment to consider which one applies to you then we will discuss a passage from Scriptures and get your thoughts on that. First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn’t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith. Oddly enough, I can definitely relate to all this attitudes although I don’t hold any of them now I can see how I could and might have these views and where you might stand in the conversation?\n\nLet me know in the comments below.\n1 / 1"}, {"id": 32133, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "**System**\n\nYou are a magic bot with incredible emoji and sticker creation abilities!

In the game, players can start and complete quests to progress in the storyline. Each quest has a unique ID, and the game provides two methods to interact with quests:\n1. `sm.startQuest(questID)`: This method starts a quest with the given ID.\n2. `sm.completeQuest(questID)`: This method completes a quest with the given ID.\n\nYour task is to write a function, `isQuestCompleted(parentID, questID)`, that determines whether a particular quest, specified by `questID`, has been completed.\n\nThe `parentID` parameter is an integer that represents the ID of the quest that can only be completed when the specified `questID` has been completed. If `parentID` is -1, it means that there is no parent quest and you should ignore this condition.\n\nYou need to implement the `isQuestCompleted` function to return `true` if the specified `questID` has been completed and `false` otherwise, taking into account the following conditions:\n- If the quest with the given `questID` has been started but not completed, the function should return `false`.\n- If the quest with the given `questID` has been completed, the function should return `true`.\n- If the quest with the given `parentID` has not been completed, the function should return `false`.\n\n**Function Signature:**\n`function isQuestCompleted(parentID: number, questID: number): boolean`\n\n**Input**\nThe function takes in two parameters:\n- `parentID` (1 <= parentID <= 1000) - an integer representing the ID of the parent quest.\n- `questID` (1 <= questID <= 1000) - an integer representing the ID of the quest to be checked.\n\n**Output**\nThe function should return a boolean value - `true` if the specified `questID` has been completed, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**Note**\n- You can assume that the `sm.startQuest` and `sm.completeQuest` methods have already been implemented and work as expected.\n- You can also assume that the quest IDs are unique and there are no duplicates.\n\n**Example**\n```\nisQuestCompleted(5, 10) => true\nisQuestCompleted(5, 10) => false\nisQuestCompleted(-1, 5) => false\n```"}, {"id": 32157, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are working on a project that involves generating Python override classes for certain C++ classes. These override classes are necessary to provide additional functionality to the existing C++ classes in Python. However, you have encountered a bug in the generation process.\n\nYou have a function called `generate_override_classes` that takes a `declaration` and a `trampoline_name_suffix` as arguments. The `declaration` is an object that represents a C++ class, and the `trampoline_name_suffix` is a string that is appended to the generated class name.\n\nYour task is to fix the bug in the provided code snippet within the `generate_override_classes` function.\n\nThe code snippet starts by appending the `member` object to the `virtual_members` list. If `virtual_members` is empty, the function should return immediately, as there are no virtual members to process.\n\nNext, the code generates a new class name called `python_override_class_name`. This name is composed of the `decl.class_.name.native` (C++ class name) and the `trampoline_name_suffix`. However, you must ensure that the generated class name is unique and does not already exist in the `python_override_class_names` dictionary. If the generated class name already exists, you need to come up with an alternative name.\n\nAfter ensuring the uniqueness of the class name, the code snippet yields a string that represents the start of the Python override class declaration. The declaration should indicate that the Python override class inherits from the C++ class, `decl.class_.name.cpp_name`, and also from another class called `self_life_support`.\n\nThe code snippet then yields another string that uses the `using` keyword to inherit all the members from the C++ class, `decl.class_.name.cpp_name`, into the Python override class.\n\nFinally, the code snippet uses a loop to iterate over each `member` in `virtual_members`. You need to complete the code inside the loop to process each virtual member appropriately.\n\nWrite the correct implementation for the `generate_override_classes` function, fixing the bug in the code snippet."}, {"id": 32158, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "You are a senior software developer.

Customers may decide to try a competitor’s product. They may no longer have need of your product. They may have had a bad experience with you.\nBut these lapsed customers have a history with you, and you have some knowledge about them. That means that you may be able to recover their business. It certainly makes them more likely prospects than people who have never done business with you.\nWhen identifying which customers are active and which are lapsed, you need to be careful about the time period you look at. Different businesses have different purchase cycles. A credit-card company might consider a customer to be lapsed if they haven’t done any transactions for six months. But an auto dealer wouldn’t flag a customer as lapsed a year after they signed a two-year lease.\nWhen designing a reactivation campaign, it’s important to try to understand why a customer has lapsed. If it’s a service or quality issue, you may communicate to them about improvements that have been made in that regard. Automobile companies often take this approach after recalls, for example.\nIt’s also important to understand what your lapsed customers were doing before they lapsed. Clues to why they stopped doing business with you may be found in their previous purchase history.\nSome customers, called transactors, do a lot of transactions and pay off their balances every month. Other customers, called revolvers, carry large balances over every month. Still others don’t do much at all.\nThis last group of inactive cardholders can be divided into two subgroups. First you have the truly inactive cardholders — those who have never used their cards at all. The other subgroup is your lapsed cardholders. These customers have used their card in the past but have since stopped.\nNow, suppose you’re asked to design a reactivation campaign targeted at these lapsed cardholders. A critical piece of information for you is which category these cardholders fell into when they were active. In other words, you need to know which ones were transactors and which ones were revolvers.\nTheir previous behavior offers strong clues about why they left. The transactor didn’t leave you to take advantage of a low-interest balance transfer. He didn’t have a balance. But the revolver may well have done just that.\nThis line of thought leads to two different reactivation strategies. You focus on usage with one group and balances with the other. You offer cash back or other rewards to the lapsed transactors, for example. And you offer low-interest balance transfers to the lapsed revolvers.\nThe success of your reactivation campaigns depends heavily on your understanding of why your customers lapsed in the first place. As the preceding example illustrates, previous purchase history can sometimes tell you quite a bit. But understanding why customers lapse is also a popular subject for survey research. You can gain a lot of insight by just asking some of these customers where they went and why."}, {"id": 32219, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "I want as a general practitioner to do deliberate practice in initial assessment of patients seeking help for depression.

I count myself fortunate to have worked with her on a number of occasions, not least because she is a fantastic professional who models patience, dialogue and enquiry in everything she says and does. If you have not encountered her teaching, I encourage you to move mountains to get to one of her workshops. Now.\nI am still learning from the way she turns diverting anecdote into profound instructions for writing and for life: ‘The best time to write is when you are tired; your conscious mind is less interfering then.’ Or: ‘See if you can finish a draft of a poem in the time it takes to run a bath.’ I see these remarks as more of a life-raft than a touchstone. I have lost count of the times they have kept me afloat in dark times.\nOne day she turned up to a workshop with a slim volume of her poems in her hand. ‘This is for you,’ she said without ceremony, and began teaching. The book was a pamphlet called Vehicle (Slow Dancer, 1999). It grieves me more than I can say that it is out of print. I loved it instantly, sneaking quick readings of poems between exercises. It contains descriptions of things that are fantastically hard to do well: cats, dogs, unemployment, train stations. It has the most beautiful poem about and for one of my other heroes, Michael Laskey. All of it feels natural and utterly controlled.\nFor some reason, though, ‘Instructor’ is the poem from Vehicle that really got to me. It is a microcosm of everything Ann does so well, in poem after poem, here and in all her books: beginning in medias res, no flag waving or signposting from behind the poem, just jump straight in. There is trust in the reader. You see it in her use of proper nouns (Milnsbridge, Cowlersley), the one line of dialogue (‘Wave back. Don’t smile.’) which gives a whole life, the eye for the killer detail (‘reaching past me for his medicine’).\nI wish, I wish, I wish Ann Sansom published more.\ninto his mobile or reaching past me for his medicine.\ntwo constables pause and turn on the pavement to salute us.\nthree ways to recognise an unmarked car.\nMakes me want to read it over and over and over.

This terrane forms part of the Namaqua metamorphic complex that was amalgamated during the 1.1 to 1.2 Ma Namaqua Orogeny. Preserved stratigraphic sequences can be followed on strike (hundred km scale) in domains of relatively low strain. In high strain (more than 12γ) zones, the sequences are discontinuous. Inversion and duplication owing to thrusting and folding are more prevalent in the latter than in the former.\nThe Aggeneys Hills is situated in a regional high strain zone and comprises a late synformal macro-structure, superimposed on five older structural domains. The exposed dimensions of the macro-structure is 20km by 5km and the strike length of the five recumbent folds is 6 to 17km. Zones of high strain that are localised in relatively ductile quartzite-schist sequences separate the recumbent folds. The geometry and stratigraphic relationships of the macro-folds indicate that the stratigraphic packages in the Aggeneys Hills were tectonically emplaced as fold nappes. Collectively these nappes represent a duplex structure.\nThe five fold nappes have been named Soutkloof, Quarry, Klipbok, Dassie and Dabbiepoort. The Quarry fold nappe was chosen as an example to illustrate the details of the structural development of the Aggeneys Hills. Although the deformation is interpreted to have been a progressive ductile shear process, five successive structural events can be locally recognised (D1–5).\nThe Quarry fold nappe is interpreted to be a large kilometre scale sheath fold. The sheath fold provides information about the nature and orientation of the regional strain ellipsoid; the XY-plane trends easterly and is subhorizontal with the X-direction subparallel to the southwesterly trending tectonic transport direction. The mega sheath fold has an allochtonous structure in its northern limb containing correlates of mineralised stratabound units (the Gams member of the Hotson Formation). Structural duplication of ore bearing units may well be present in the unexposed core of the Quarry structure. Similar structural duplication is to be expected in the rest of the high strain zone of the Aggeneys terrane.\nS29°11'60\" - S29°11'60\", E18°46'00\" - E18°55'00\"\nWhat is the significance of the Quarry fold nappe and its orientation in relation to the regional strain ellipsoid?"}, {"id": 32253, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "help me make an calculator from scratch with DevOps and Cloud.

The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.\n\"A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!\"\nI'd been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry's obsession with \"practical steps\" -- and how, whenever the word \"practical\" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it's implied that a list of steps will follow. It's as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that \"stepular\" is not a word but maybe should be.)\nMy friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That's why it's practical. (Aren't words fun?) Practical doesn't mean \"I can follow this without turning on my brain.\"\nFor instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.\nFeeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.\nKnowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.\nYou get it. I'm passionate about this.\nAnd so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:\n\"A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!\"\nSmack.\nSwig.\nSmile.\n(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn't entirely unhappy.)\nA list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way.\n • If you're on the wrong path, you don't need \"next steps.\" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don't move forward.\n • If you aren't saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.\n • If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don't yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure carpenters don't sit around saying, \"Should I use a hammer?\" I mean ... what are you trying to build?\nIf success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that's not reality.\nAs a result, more often than we realize, we don't need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that \"stepful\" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.\nWe need to face the right way.\nThis brings me to the idea of \"story\" and how it's typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn't actually where we need to go. I'd sum up this issue like this:\nMost advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.\nThese are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you're a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.\nMisconception #1: Stories are special.\nVery commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.\nBut then, yanno ... most of them aren't. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.\n • The monthly all-hands meeting.\n • The company home page.\n • The oft-promoted case study.\n • The new podcast trailer.\n • The big, important essay.\n • The opening moments of a keynote.\nThat's the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.\nStories aren't for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You'll serve others better and so will be better served.\n • When you start to face the path labeled \"Stories are special,\" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path \"Story Everywhere.\"\nMisconception #2: Stories are abstract.\nSomething that is \"abstract\" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.\nThat's how we view this notion of \"story\" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):\n\"So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?\"\nWhat, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?\nTo me, that's like asking, \"What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?\"\nYES! That's just how we communicate. But just as marketers view \"emotions\" as only these extreme things (nope, they're implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view \"story\" as these abstract things. It's all very much OUT THERE.\nEMOTIONS!\nSTORY!\n(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)\nAbstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.\nThe solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let's make this more concrete, shall we?\n • You experienced some stuff. Describe it.\n • You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.\nYou have an idea. You ship the idea. It's concrete now. It exists.\nPrioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.\nThe reason we don't do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It's both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...\nCreative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see \"the code of the Matrix.\" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It's only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It's like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.\nThe internet has put much more of the \"code\" of the creative \"Matrix\" on full \"display.\" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!\nAlso?\nThat level of access is intimidating!\nBecause we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven't produced anything. Other times, it doesn't feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.\nPoppycock.\nThat way of thinking is cock of the poppy.\n(Don't be offended. \"Poppycock\" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning \"soft dung.\" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)\nImagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we'd say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.\nWe would never utter a word.\nBut what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.\nYou've heard stories. So just... start... telling them.\nIf and when you get stuck, no problem. You can find a key to that door rather easily thanks to allllll that easily accessible information. But you don't need it to start or even elevate your work! You can simply start, learn, and keep going. All that advice should serve YOU, but way too often, it feels like we're trying to serve it. Don't try to find clarity to justify creating. Create to find clarity.\nIt's in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It's in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else's ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.\nIf you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.\nThe best way to find a groove is to start grooving.\n • When you start to face the path labeled \"Stories are abstract,\" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path \"Ship Stories Sooner.\""}, {"id": 32256, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "explain the difference between hinduism and buddhism in the style of Jerry Seinfeld"}, {"id": 32257, "actor": "Entertainment & Politics", "prompt": "Are there any legal risks involved with torrenting, and if so, how can they be avoided?"}, {"id": 32258, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "Can you summarize the main idea of the text material on the topic of generic drugs vs brand name drugs?: The lone and hydraulic diesel generic drugs vs brand name essay Erick gives you ap psychology unit 5 essay outline and removes your singles or siesta in a binchois de plus en analysis essay simple way.

Answer according to: Again the same process new glugged hook baits and freebies on the spot, by now the heavens had opened and it wasn’t due to stop until 5am. At 10pm and the bar rod was away again a short while later I had another common laying in the net, I was just about to break the net down when the gully rod roared off. Unfortunately after a couple of minutes it came off after checking the hook the point had been pushed over maybe the hook caught the bony part of the fishes mouth or it hit a stone in the silt who knows but a fresh hook link was attached and put back out on the spot. Before I did all this with the fish was weighed and released, it weighed 14lb by this time I was soaked through as I hadn’t had time to put the waterproofs on.\n11pm I heard an alarm but it wasn’t mine it was my dad’s I wandered down to the next swim to see how he was getting on and he had one of the lakes smaller fish it wasn’t weighed but I reckon about 8 or 9 lbs. I just got back into my sleeping bag and the gully rod was off again, this time the waterproofs went on and I was into a better fish after it going under the other line and back over the other way the rods were untangled I had it in the net within minutes. It weighed 16lbs I was made up with the session so far only been fishing for 6hrs and having a few on the bank. I don’t normally do this but due to this rain lashing down I decided to not put the rod back out but the bait was still put out on the spot to keep them grubbing about. 2am the bar rod was away and it didn’t feel that big as it kept shaking its head left and right normally signalling a smaller fish. I was right a 11lb mirror. Same happened to this rod I re-baited but didn’t cast out, I set my alarm for 530am hoping the rain had stopped it hadn’t so I just sat up watching the water for any signs of fish over the spots. 7am arrived and plenty of tea consumed and the rain stopped but I hadn’t seen any fish I put the rods back on the spots, the weather had warmer up a lot it was now 9 degrees at 830am. I kept looking for any signs of fish activity but none, by 9am nothing so the rods came in and I went for a wander around the lake as I knew the fish were in the shallower water by now making the most of the December sun. Due to the flooded swims all the swims that I wanted were taken so I decided to move to another lake.\nI arrived at the mere at 2pm, you have probably read about it in my previous articles, I know this place like the back of my hand and I am after just 1 fish out of here the fully scaled called bullseye. Due the weather still being warm all day and night we set up in the middle of the lake with depths of 5 to 6ft in front of us. My rods were cast out on spots that I have been fishing this year. My rigs were 7inch -combi rigs with a snowman, the only difference here is that I use the Vor-Tex topped with the signature pop ups in pink and white. 20 freebies were put over the top of each rod.\nThe afternoon and night passed without any signs of any fish or bleeps on the alarm, I woke up at midnight and set my alarm for 530am to hopefully hear something. If I didn’t I was going to up sticks and move down to the shallow end. Around 6ish I heard some carp crashing out but as it’s still dark I couldn’t quite see where they were but I knew they weren’t too far away from one of my spots. I decided to fire out a dozen more boilies over both rods due to the amount of bream in this lake. At 10am the right rod that was near the crashing carp was away signalled a slow steady take, after guiding it away from the last remaining pads the mirror was safely in the net. It weighed 15.10 after looking at the scale pattern I realised I caught the same fish 3 weeks earlier from the same swim. After speaking to the bailiff this was the first fish out of here since I last caught this fish. A brew was made and I was scanning the water for signs of fish, I decided to put both rods on the spot where I had caught the fish from to see if they were held up there. After an hour or so after I moved the rod I saw a fish poke its head out over my original spot so the rod was wound in quickly and put on the spot where the fish had shown itself. 15 minutes later the rod was off and the fish was trying to head for the pads. Keeping steady pressure the fish was out of harm’s way and playing about under the rod tip. The mirror weighed 13.8lbs a few snaps were taken and it was released back. Shortly after that fish I decided that it was time to pack up, whilst packing away the rod was away again but this time I had hooked a tufftie."}, {"id": 32266, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "Act as the prompt generator for UI process and I will give you the main keywords by:\n1 Information Product\n-Product Name\n-Brand Name\n-Mail\n-Domain Name\n\n2.

The call graph represents the dependencies between various functions. In the code, the `trace_calls` function is called recursively to build the call graph. The overall process involves assigning a rank to each function and constructing an adjacency list to represent the dependencies between functions.\n\nYour task is to implement a function, `construct_call_graph`, that takes two parameters: `XML` (a string representing XML data) and `FUNCTION` (the name of a top-level function). Your function should return the call graph constructed by the code snippet.\n\nA call graph is represented as a dictionary, where the keys are function names and the values are lists of function names that the key function calls (direct dependencies). The call graph should include all functions encountered during the recursive call to `trace_calls`.\n\nFor example, given the following code snippet:\n\n```\nFUNCS[$next_rank]=$func\nrank[$func]=$next_rank\n((next_rank++))\ndone\n\n# Create adjacency list for $2 and also mark treated:\ngraph[$2]=${FUNCS[@]}\n\nfor func in ${FUNCS[@]}; do\n    trace_calls $1 \"${func}\"\ndone\n}\n\ninfo \"Constructing call graph recursively...\"\ntrace_calls \"${XML}\" \"${FUNCTION}\"\n```\n\nand the function call `construct_call_graph(xml_data, \"main\")`, where `xml_data` is an XML string, your function should return a dictionary representing the call graph.\n\nNote:\n- The rank assigned to each function represents the call sequence. The rank starts at 1 and increments for each new function encountered.\n- The `trace_calls` function takes two parameters: `XML` and a function name. It is responsible for calling itself recursively for each function encountered and adding the function names to the `FUNCS` array.\n- The `graph` variable is a dictionary that contains the adjacency list for each function.

We all know the old cliché that the National Rifle Association has power because its members vote on the guns issue, while gun-control people aren’t zealots. Well, Wayne LaPierre and 46 craven senators, that “majority” of the Senate, have just created millions of zealots, and as furious as I am, I’m also strangely at peace, because I’m more confident than ever that the NRA will never, ever be stronger in Washington than it was yesterday.\nHistorians will see this recent debate, culminating in yesterday’s vote, as the time when the gun-control lobby grew and coalesced. The gun issue, since the 1970s a blunt instrument used mainly to bully rural-state Democrats, is going to start turning into the opposite: pressure on blue- and purple-state Republicans to vote at least for modest measures. And make no mistake, what the Senate voted on yesterday was modest; far too modest, in that we can’t even discuss banning the online sale of limitless amounts of ammunition. The NRA won this one, but as President Obama said in some of the most passionate remarks of his public life yesterday evening, this is just “round one.” More rounds are coming, and the balance of power is going to change.\nYou cannot oppose the will of 90 percent of the public and expect no consequences. You can’t have people saying what Rand Paul said, that monstrous comment of his about Newtown parents being “props,” and think that you haven’t offended and infuriated millions of people. You can’t introduce amendments that encourage more interstate transfer of weapons and give it the way-beyond-Orwellian name “safe communities” act and think that karma will never come back around on you. And you can’t sneer at the parents of dead 6-year-olds and expect that God isn’t watching and taking notes.\nSickening. The whole thing. The four cowardly Democrats, too. Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor, and Heidi Heitkamp. Heitkamp won’t face her voters again for five years. Baucus has been around long enough to be able to be bigger than this. Begich and Pryor, who face reelection next year, have the least lame excuses of all, but they are cowards too. They have to know they did the wrong thing. If Joe Manchin could do what he did—and trust me, I’m from West Virginia, and I know Joe, and our families knew each other, and the whole thing. If Manchin could do what he did, from a state every bit as tough on this issue as theirs, these four pygmies really have to be ashamed of themselves.\nManchin’s courage was remarkable. To say on national television yesterday morning that the NRA lied, just flat-out say it, is amazing. Yes, he has five years too before he faces the voters of West Virginia. We’ll see how that goes in time. I hope, in 2017, we don’t see him suddenly carrying the NRA’s water. But I don’t think so. I think once you leave the church, you leave. He’s like Keanu Reeves at the end of The Devil’s Advocate. He has left Satan’s embrace. Much credit is due Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, too. I don’t know whether a Republican primary is now headed his way in 2016, but as right wing as he is on virtually every issue, he at least stepped forward and tried to be a legislator.\nObama’s words were the most powerful he’s delivered in years. Call it failed if you want, but this was leadership: knowing that he was probably going to lose on the Hill, but putting everything he had into the fight anyway. He took on not only the NRA and its whores in Congress, he took on the blasé complacency of a pundit class that said repeatedly: he’ll never win, so why do this; he should have struck while the iron was hot; he should have talked to Republicans more. Yes, it was clear that a challenge to the NRA was likely to lose, but that isn’t what always should dictate a politician’s actions. He behaved out of conviction. This is rare enough among politicians that Obama certainly should not be nitpicked for this or that little thing he did or didn’t do.\nThis was one of the blackest days in the Senate’s history. It’s right up there with the filibusters of civil-rights bills. And make no mistake, this is a civil-rights issue. The gun nuts—and obviously, not all gun owners are nuts, not even a majority—fulminate endlessly about their rights. Well, that little boy at the Sandy Hook school who got his jaw blown clean off, whose unimaginably brave mother insisted on an open casket so people would have to deal with the reality of what guns can do, had civil rights too, the first one of which is safety in his person. So did his classmates and teachers, and so did the hundreds, thousands of victims, a train of corpses that could stretch around the world, silenced in life, and silenced again yesterday by Mitch McConnell and 45 other people who now have a little bit of those victims’ blood splattered on their hands. They will yet be heard from.\nCORRECTION: I originally forgot to include Mark Pryor as one of the Democrats who voted no. That paragraph has been reworked to include him.

To lose 0.5 kg in a week’s time – strictly through exercise – you’d need to burn up an extra 500 calories a day, above and beyond your current activity level. That’s no small task. You’d need to hike uphill for an hour with a 4 to 5 kg backpack or swim laps for 90 minutes – without stopping. Trying to lose weight only through increased activity – or only by cutting your calories – won’t be nearly as effective as a combination of diet and exercise.\nCutting calories may cause your metabolic rate to drop somewhat. Your metabolic rate represents the number of calories your body burns just to keep basic processes going - and is a big part of your ‘calories out’. But your metabolic rate can dip a little when you cut back on your eating. So even though your ‘calories in’ may be lower, your ‘calories out’ can drop, too – and leave you more or less in calorie balance.\nStrength training can help to increase metabolic rate. When people think ‘exercise’, they usually think aerobic exercise, like cycling, swimming or jogging. But strength training is important, too – in part because it helps to build lean body mass, which can bump up your metabolic rate and help offset the drop in calorie burn that takes place when you cut your calories.\nIt’s easy to make mistakes when counting calories – both in and out. People tend to overestimate the calorie cost of the exercise they do – and underestimate the number of calories they eat. Which helps explain the frustration many people feel when they’re sure they’re doing ‘everything right’ – but the scale just won’t budge.\nExercise is key to good health and anything is better than nothing. When people hear that they might need an hour or more of exercise a day to keep their weight under control, it can be a little daunting. But don’t let the numbers discourage you. Do what you can, do it regularly, and try to go a little further – or work out a little harder – each time."}, {"id": 32374, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "Write a joke"}, {"id": 32375, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "Please correct the spelling and grammar of the following sentence, then explain the changes you've made:\nIt was said: \"Have you established the measure through the measure, and you are bound by the fact that the measure is a branch and not a root?

However, during her labour, it became apparent that Peter was quite a big baby and, due to this, they took his mother to theatre to monitor her progress.\nPeter’s head was delivered first, but due to his size, his shoulders became stuck (shoulder dystocia). Multiple attempts were made to deliver his body, including the use of a ventouse (vacuum cup) and forceps. The McRoberts position (a manoeuvre often used in this situation) was not adopted, nor was an episiotomy.\nIt was unclear from the records how long there was between the delivery of Peter’s head and his body, but the degree of trauma our client suffered to his head and neck was disproportionate to the amount of traction required to deliver a baby, even under these very difficult circumstances.\nWhen Peter was born, he was floppy and not breathing on his own, so he needed help from machines. He also had a wound to his head as a result of the attempted delivery.\nPeter recovered fairly well in NICU and was breathing independently. However, a lump on the side of his neck was noted and, after further investigation, it was found that he had suffered a severe brachial plexus injury that affected the nerves found at C5, C6 and C7. \nDuring the first 10 years of his life, our client underwent five separate procedures to try and improve the long-standing impact of his birth injuries, all of which only helped a little. Peter was unable to raise his right arm above shoulder height and had restrictive movement in his right shoulder. He also had significant scarring on his back due to the amount of surgery he required.

Pritchard said. This is a great premise to hold onto while writing a short story; stories are a window into a life, not the whole enchilada.\n\nThese five tips for making sure you’re creating enough conflict to keep your reader turning the pages may seem like basics, but I still use them as good reminders about what’s crucial to writing an engaging short story. Often, I’ll write an entire draft and forget about a few of these necessary elements. But always, they show themselves through many revisions, as they are always necessary to make a story really sing.\n\n1. Have your character want something.\nYour character needs to be presented in a way that they desire something, but they do not have it yet. It can be a possession, a person, even a trip to somewhere. In the title story of my book, Alina is stalking her daughter’s boyfriend in a creepy way. In the first paragraph we learn she is outside the boyfriend’s apartment every morning, in the afternoons she’s at the coffee shop when he gets his cup of joe, she’s hoping he’ll be haunted by her presence.\n\nHe is the reason her daughter is in trouble, the story declares. I wrote this line after many revisions, as I knew I had to be upfront about the conflict in the story. In this way, the reader wants to find out what the guy did to her daughter and feels empathy for the mother in the situation.\n\nTo know a character is to know what they want, and the story follows that pursuit.\n\n2. Create a situation that involves danger. \nAny kind of danger, from seeing a suspicious text on a spouse’s phone to being caught in a bank robbery. The tension of that situation is what carries the story forward and becomes its anchor. Unlike novels, every sentence in a short story has to involve developing the plot or revealing more about the character. In revision, I tend to move paragraphs and reshape the way a story unfolds, not unlike rearranging furniture in a room. I cut big chunks that don’t need to be there, like taking out that old sofa you love, but in the end, it has to go. In my story, “How I Became A Banker,” the first line is, When I was twelve I made a promise to myself that I’d make a shitload of money. The reader immediately wants to know why the narrator made such a promise and at such a young age. Again, I didn’t come to this line until after many revisions.\n\n3. Conjure up complications. \nWhatever the situation you create, add some complication to it: Nicola is tempted to flirt with the tattoo artist and does so, and then discovers that the tattoo artist’s assistant is an old school buddy of her boyfriend. She flirts because she is determined to ruin her life, her goal is self-destruction, not messing up her relationship. It’s complicated and sorrowful and the reader is hooked. Be on the lookout for plots that surprise you. It’s usually a good thing.\n\n4. Hide the real problem. \n“It’s not the mud on the floor,” my mother used to say. She meant it as a metaphor for when things go wrong and it seems it’s one thing that’s bothering a person, but it’s usually something else. For example, in my story “You’re Here Now,” Sylvie has never met her father, but she’s on the way to his funeral. The story seems to be about the loss of ever having a relationship with her father, but the reader soon realizes the story is about the resentment she has toward her mother, who never let her see her father or his large family. It’s the hidden thing, the complication behind what is initially presented that can make stories so rich.\n\n5. Make sure the readers know the trouble early, like a few paragraphs in. \nIt’s almost a cliché to say write a story and then delete the first two pages to get to the “heat” or “pulse” of it.\n\nIn Flannery O'Connor's famous story \"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\" the first line gives trouble that seems minor, though it will lead to the catastrophe at the end: The grandmother didn't want to go to Florida. It can be as simple as that, to start."}, {"id": 32447, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "Can you improve this code?

According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, \"The Ides of March are come\", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied \"Aye, Caesar; but not gone.\" This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to \"beware the Ides of March.\" The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the \"seer\" as a haruspex named Spurinna.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: who was told beware the ides of march?\nCoT: The important part for answering this question is: This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to \"beware the Ides of March.\"\n\nAns: July\nQues: World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918.

Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history and precipitated major political change, including the Revolutions of 1917 -- 1923 in many of the nations involved.

The stack will be used to store objects. However, there are certain conditions and exceptions that need to be handled. \n\nThe given code snippet shows two functions of an `objectStack` class: `top()` and `pop()`. `top()` function is meant to return the object that is at the top of the stack. On the other hand, `pop()` function is expected to remove and return the topmost object from the stack.\n\nHowever, there are some problems with the code. In both functions, there is a check for stack underflow, which occurs when an operation is performed on an empty stack. If a stack underflow occurs, a custom exception `stackunderflow` is thrown with an appropriate error message. \n\nYour task is to fix the issues in the code snippet and implement appropriate exception handling to ensure that the stack underflow conditions are properly addressed.\n\nWrite a program that accomplishes the following:\n\n1. Implement the `objectStack` class with the following functions:\n   - `object *top()`: This function should return the element at the top of the stack without removing it. Handle the stack underflow condition by throwing a `stackunderflow` exception with the message: \"Stack underflow occurred in top() function\".\n   - `object *pop()`: This function should remove the topmost element from the stack and return it. Handle the stack underflow condition by throwing a `stackunderflow` exception with the message: \"Stack underflow occurred in pop() function\".\n\n2.

Other common causes of visual impairment in older adults are cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.\nThere are two kinds of AMD. They are referred to as dry, or atrophic, AMD, and wet AMD, which also referred to as neovascular or exudative AMD. Dry AMD typically progresses slowly over many years and is less threatening to vision than wet AMD.\nOften, dry AMD is monitored and not treated. A significant number of patients with dry AMD eventually do develop wet AMD.\nMuch effort has been put into developing a treatment for wet AMD. Two vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors - which were initially developed as anti-cancer treatments - are now commonly used in the treatment of wet AMD.\nVEGF is a protein found in all humans. Its function is to cause growth of blood vessels. It is necessary for normal growth, repair and replacement of older tissues and the healing of wounds. VEGF is found in high levels in tissues of the macula of the eye as it is being damaged by the vascular growth characteristic of wet AMD.\nWell designed clinical studies have shown that ranibizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, significantly inhibits VEGF activity and benefits patients with wet AMD when injected directly into the eye. An injection directly into the eye is called an intravitreal injection.\nOne trial randomized 716 patients to 24 monthly injections with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, or sham injection into the eye. Over the two years, those treated with either dose of ranibizumab had less vision decrease than those getting the sham injection.\nSome patients treated with the VEGF inhibitor actually had improved vision. Ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis) was approved for treatment of wet AMD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 at a dose of 0.5 mg by injection into the eye every month. In this study and several confirmatory studies, about one out of every 100 patients treated got endophthalmitis.\nThis is an inflammation of the internal parts of the eye due to chemical irritation caused by a high concentration of the drug. It often leads to blindness. The FDA also noted that there is a small increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction with ranibizumab treatment.\nBevacizumab (trade name Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor closely related to ranibizumab. Bevacizumab is FDA-approved in the United States as an intravenous infusion to treat colorectal cancer and is commonly used to treat metastatic breast cancer.\nBevacizumab is frequently used off label as an intravitreal treatment of wet AMD. Off-label use is legal in the U.S. and is commonly done in medicine. A dose of bevacizumab for treatment of AMD is considerably cheaper (about $100) than a dose of ranibizumab (about $2,000). While bevacizumab has not been FDA-approved for AMD, studies comparing intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab found no difference in effectiveness.\nThe rate of serious side effects was slightly higher with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab (24% versus 19%).\nMajor side effects of these drugs when given into the eye included pneumonia and urinary tract infections, nausea, vomiting and some gastrointestinal bleeding. There were a few patients who had stroke and myocardial infarction.\nThe risk of endophthalmitis was the same with bevacizumab and ranibizumab. While intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and ranibizumab is the standard method of use today, intravenous administration of bevacizumab is also being studied in the treatment of AMD. This might lower the risk of endophthalmitis and blindness considerably.\n« Previous entryHuman Factor: How big are your dreams?\nviagra soft 50 mg – And muscle the conformity a into.

To make the process more efficient, you decided to write a function that decodes a JWT and replaces the encoded token in the editor with the decoded version. You are given a code snippet that includes the function `jwtDecode` which performs the decoding and replacement.\n\nThe function `jwtDecode` takes an argument `env`, which represents the environment in which the function is called. `env` has two properties: `env.region` and `env.env`. \n\nThe `env.region` property is a string that represents the currently selected text region in the editor.

The reason why flight is surprisingly rare is that  _\nWhen Archaeopteryx, a feathered skeleton that was seemingly half dinosaur and half bird, turned up in 1862-three years after the publication of \"The Origin of Species\"-the origin of birds became a subject of raging debate among palaeontologists. Suggestions that they were the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs (a group of bipedal meat-eaters that include Allosaurus, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus) caused quite a flap. Today, most researchers agree that birds are, indeed, a branch of the Dinosauria. How they made the transition from the land to the sky, though, has yet to be agreed. But a paper in this week's Current Biology, by Christopher Glen and Michael Bennett of the University of Queensland, makes a strong case that they did it by jumping.\nConsidering the diversity of life on Earth, flight is surprisingly rare. It has evolved only four times: among the insects about 300m years ago, the pterosaurs (230m), the birds (150m) and the bats (50m). That suggests it is a hard trick to pull off. For birds, there is general agreement that feathers came before flight. Fossils from north-eastern China show animals that had feathers but clearly could not have flown, as well as ones that look like proper birds. The best guesses are that feathers evolved either for insulation (as fur did in mammals) or for display, and that natural selection took advantage by turning them into a means of transport.\nThere are two broad schools of thought about what happened next. One argues that birds' immediate ancestors lived in trees. Members of this school think that powered flight developed as a natural extension of gliding (such controlled falling is used as a way of travelling from tree to tree by several arboreal species today). Gliding itself developed because of the lift provided by feathered forearms.\nThe alternative is that flight evolved on the ground. Some researchers who belong to this school of thought suggest that the power provided by flapping protowings may have given their owners an edge in the pursuit of prey. Others hypothesise that feathery forearms helped animals steer and stabilise themselves.\nUnfortunately, behaviour does not fossilise, so it looked as though the question might never be answered. But Dr Glen, a palaeobiologist, and Dr Bennett, a biomechanic, think they have worked out how to do so. Their crucial observation is that in modern birds the curvature of the third toe (which carries a lot of weight during walking and climbing) varies with species' lifestyles. Birds that spend lots of time climbing around on the trunks of trees have dramatically curved third toes. Those that hop around on branches have mildly curved ones. Those that forage mainly on the ground have the least curved of all.\nThe two researchers compared these observations with their findings for the bird-like dinosaurs and dinosaur-like birds of China. They noticed that the toes of both feathered dinosaurs and of the earliest flying birds were similar to those of modern birds that spend most of their time on the ground. Flight, in other words, came before birds took to the trees. They are not fallen angels, but risen reptiles.\n\nA: feathers evolved not for a means of transport.\nB: it is very hard to have such evolution.\nC: life on earth is diversified.\nD: many species of this kind were eliminated during evolution."}, {"id": 32580, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "Who are you?"}, {"id": 32581, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "\"Content Warning: This work of fiction contains mature themes, explicit sexual content, graphic violence, and strong language.

Finally, if `f(r)` is equal to 0, it returns `r`; otherwise, it returns `x`.\n\nThe `EqualsNearly` extension method is defined for doubles. It takes two parameters: `x` and `y`, and an optional parameter `digits` with a default value of 12.

Additionally, can you explain how to use Markdown format to present arguments and evidence in a clear and organized manner?\nHere is an example of a successful algorithm for generating creative responses in a chatbot using JavaScript and JSON data:\n{\n  \"greetings\": [\"Hello!\", \"Hi there!\", \"Greetings!\"],\n  \"questions\": [\"How can I assist you today?\", \"What can I help you with?\", \"How may I be of service?\"],\n  \"responses\": {\n    \"greeting\": [\"Hello!

Please hold on.\"],\n    \"thankyou\": [\"You're welcome!\", \"My pleasure!\", \"Anytime!\"]\n  }\n}\nTo use this algorithm, the chatbot can randomly select a greeting or question from the respective arrays, and respond accordingly. The responses object contains different responses for different situations, such as when the user greets the chatbot, asks a question, or expresses gratitude.\nAs for using Markdown format, it is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text with simple syntax. To present arguments and evidence in a clear and organized manner using Markdown, you can use headings, lists, and emphasis to structure your content. For example:\n# Introduction\nIn this essay, I will argue that chatbots can generate creative responses comparable to or better than humans. \n## Background\nChatbots have been around for decades, but recent advances in artificial intelligence and natural language processing have made them more sophisticated than ever before. \n## Evidence\nStudies have shown that chatbots can accurately answer a wide range of questions and provide personalized recommendations to users. Furthermore, chatbots can learn from their interactions with users and improve over time. \n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, chatbots have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other. By leveraging the power of AI and natural language processing, chatbots can provide creative and helpful responses that rival those of humans."}, {"id": 32625, "actor": "Business Marketing & Social Media Strategy", "prompt": "Given an essay topic, generate a thesis statement that outlines the main argument of the essay.\nTopic: The impact of social media on society"}, {"id": 32626, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "Jane is on a diet but really wants dessert after dinner.

When describing the increase in violence as a “surge”, 60 Minutes is certainly not exaggerating; this year’s homicide total in Chicago is up by 56% from last year, and up almost 75% from 2013.\nHowever, CBS is certainly exaggerating when it compares Chicago to a “war zone” – in Afghanistan, for example, US forces have averaged 300+ murders per 100,000 since the 2001 invasion. With a 2016 homicide rate of ~29 per 100,000, Chicago’s homicide rate hasn’t reached the 1992 peak of ~32 per 100,000. Can anyone recall CBS comparing Chicago to a “war zone” in the 1990s?\n60 Minutes centered its coverage on a drop in stops and arrests by police, with a focus on blaming the police for creating a crime-filled environment, with scarce mention of the perpetrators behind the increase in violent crime. They also mentioned low police morale, new policies on racial profiling and police reporting, gang members posting video of confrontations with police, and “fear of becoming the next viral video” in their piece. What was conveniently left out of the entire report?\nAny mention whatsoever of Black Lives Matter, or any of the other nationwide protests against police that are primarily driven by race. Of course, these protests almost always occur when the “victim” is black, regardless of whether or not the perpetrator in question was wrongfully shot or not.\nMcCarthy directly cited BLM as responsible for creating an atmosphere of fear in police departments the same day this report was released, yet none of this was in the report on 60 Minutes. Since McCarthy has been singing the same tune since he was dismissed, it is reasonable to believe that CBS deliberately edited any mention of nationwide protests or BLM from the portions of their interview with McCarthy that they chose to air.\nOfficer Veronica Murillo says it was the fear of becoming the next viral video that kept her from pulling her gun as she struggled with this suspect. He knocked her down and bashed her head into the pavement. She suffered neurological damage that has endangered her career.\nMichael Pfleger: I’ve never seen there to be a combination of anger, distrust, and a feeling like communities have been abandoned.\nShame on us that our children are afraid to go out of their house of being shot and killed. When is the tipping point, do we all say, enough?\nEven current Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson, also featured in the 60 Minutes report, has begun following in predecessor McCarthy’s footsteps, and now ascribes part of the blame of officers’ unwillingness to engage on the streets to anti-police sentiment.\nObviously there was no mention of Johnson’s blame of anti-police sentiment deriving from nationwide protests. Yet another chance to mention BLM and national protests that 60 Minutes chose to omit. More convenient editing?\nThe majority of the 60 Minutes report focuses on police and how they have changed doing their job, without any mention of the primary reason why: a national anti-police atmosphere which has hamstrung police and led them to fear doing their job to the best of their ability. Nowhere is this more pertinent than Chicago, a large city with a massive gang and criminal element centered in a few bad neighborhoods.\nIf there is ever to be any meaningful police reform, race should not be the focus. Reforming our for-profit criminal justice system is a great place to start instead. The majority of police activity is profit-based, not crime-based – just think about the number of cops writing speeding tickets who could instead be solving crimes. Making profound changes to an overmilitarized police force is necessary, as countless people of all races are illegally surveilled, wrongfully arrested, have their personal property seized, sometimes in unnecessary SWAT raids, and all of this police conduct is totally tolerated by the MSM. Real reform in the war on drugs, which is driving a large amount of this activity, needs to be done for any other reforms to be effective. Holding police accountable for their mistakes is but one piece of a much larger puzzle to solve regarding police reform.\nAt least 60 Minutes finally got something correct this time around in their reporting. They did not blame gun laws as the problem for Chicago’s violence. That is quite a turnabout, given the program’s history in blaming gun laws for all gun violence in the USA. I’d say its a positive development, but I won’t hold my breath expecting CBS to all of a sudden turn away from its MSM narratives and the “news” they peddle to the masses.\nCould you paraphrase the argument being made in the text about the cause of police reluctance to engage in crime-ridden areas?"}, {"id": 32666, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "When you act out of compassion or kindness, what motivates you?"}, {"id": 32667, "actor": "Prime Numbers & Mathematical Symbols", "prompt": "Compute the 6623 x 9769 and obtain the result.

That number would have been considerably lower were it not for the addition of\n25,000 temporary census workers.\nThe report was not all bleak — wages rose at a healthy clip, and people who had not been looking for work returned\nto the job market — but the signs of a slowdown were unmistakable. The private sector added just 96,000 jobs, a\nsteep deceleration from earlier in the year.\nThe report also revised down job gains for June and July by a total of 20,000.\n“We’ve lost steam — there’s no question we are slowing,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n“We are losing momentum.”\nWorries about a potential recession have mounted in recent weeks, driven by the trade war, new evidence of\nweaker growth in Asia and Europe, and movements in the bond market. Another negative factor is that the stimulus\nfrom the tax cut enacted in late 2017 is fading.\nPresident Trump imposed a new 15 percent tariff on more than $100 billionworth of Chinese imports, many of them\nconsumer goods, at the start of this month. And the administration has said an existing 25 percent tariff on $250\nbillion in Chinese products will rise to 30 percent in October.\nAfter the jobs report, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the economy was strong and blamed “the Fake News” for\ncontributing to “uncertainty.”\n[Our columnist writes that a recession is not underway but growth is clearly slowing.]\n \nHiring Slowed in August, but Wage Gains Accelerated\nThe August jobs data does not suggest that a recession is imminent. The unemployment rate, for example, was\nunchanged at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low. And the labor force participation rate rose to 63.2 percent, from 63\npercent, suggesting that workers who had been on the sidelines are gradually being lured back into the labor\nmarket.\nThe proportion of Americans between the prime working ages of 25 and 54 who were employed hit 80 percent in\nAugust, the best showing in the current expansion.\n“Our labor market is in quite a strong position,” the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, said on Friday in\nZurich. “Today’s labor market report is very much consistent with that story.”\n[The Fed chair said the central bank would keep the economic expansion going.]\nAverage hourly earnings increased by 0.4 percent, which is more than analysts had expected and up from a gain of\n0.3 percent in July.

These wastes are commonly called lignocellulosic wastes that are a source of value-added products. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) for bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste, which produces various bioproducts, has economic and environmental advantages. The lignocellulosic compounds are biorenewable and most plentiful resource on earth that can be utilized for manufacturing value-added products. Furthermore, the use of lignocellulosic, starchy, and other agro-industrial by-products in the manufacture of these biomolecules has yet to be thoroughly investigated. As a result, there is a vast opportunity for the development of cost-effective, sustainable biorefining technologies. The main components of lignocellulosic biomass used in biorefineries are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. To obtain final biobased products, these components must be processed through a series of procedures that include pretreatments, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. Biotechnology techniques and process engineering are critical in developing integrated processes for producing various value-added products from lignocellulosic biomass, including biofuels, biochemicals, bioactive substances, enzymes, and biomaterials. This review focuses on the valorization potential of lignocellulosic, palm oil mill, brewing, and dairy biomass produced as agri-food industrial by-products for developing biobased products in the biorefinery scenario. It is the first review of its kind to include variety of products that can be derived from different wastes encircling all the pros and cons of current technology and focusing on future improvements.”\n\nNow, take the role of an expert consultant for the edible oils industry.

The setting is sci-fi futuristic post-apocalyptic fantasy inspired by persona 5, fire emblem, code vein, scarlet nexus, honkai impact, and genshin impact. Here is the context: hundreds of people between the ages of 15 to 25 were kidnapped from an alternate earth (homeworld) and forcefully placed into horrendous and deadly trials by a mastermind organization. The trials are intended to find skilled individuals who are deemed worthy of the mastermind organization so they can do their bidding, and consist of activities humiliating and degrading people. The game I am making now is the aftermath of the Gladiator Trials. the survivors of the prequel trials come in. They are traumatized by the trials but they don't have any power to go back home. There are two groups of survivors who are all being controlled by the mastermind organization: The Gladiators are people who passed all the trials and now work as mercenaries who are clueless as to whom they were working under and who kidnapped them in the first place. They just know they need to work as mercenaries for the 6 nations (the world they are in now) and eventually earn the trust of the nation's nobles because that's what the organization wants, and they know how to get them back home. The Renegades consist of those who failed the trials but were skilled enough to be worthy of the organization's attention and are technically given a second chance. They want to go home but don't know how. They also see that most of the nation's nobles are very corrupt, and are upset with the Gladiators for protecting them (the organization intentionally prevents the gladiators from seeing the corruption of each noble, so the gladiators also retaliate). Also, the Renegades don't think they are under the organization's control since they failed the trial and are no longer of any importance, however, the organization has moles in both teams, so they have more control.\nThere is only one storyline, however, there are multiple playable main characters that each have different perspectives on the events that occur in the story. There are a total of eight characters the players can choose to experience the story as. Six are unlocked from the get-go (three from team Gladiators and three from team Renegades) that go over lighter topics like helping the poor and being heroes and stuff. The other two playable characters are secret unlockables and are the true protagonists of the game, as they are a unique take on trickster gods. More specifically, they have many mental and emotional instabilities and are physically compromised, but they also suddenly have amnesia which messes with the organization's data of them and makes them unpredictable.
