Answer according to: In the spirit of the Lint Center's aim to progress the next generation of National Security with support for well-rounded individuals, we are proud to present the Mid-Year 2012 Scholarship Winner essays to Lint Center affiliates.", "National Security threats have plagued the United States since our independence from British rule. As a nation, we have discovered ways to ensure the safety of our citizens, freedoms, and democracy. The establishment of myriad intelligence and law enforcement agencies has met the challenges that arise as a result of our democratic growth and development. These agencies have been organized to target and attack national security threats, both foreign and domestic. The public perception of national security threats are often associated with a range of issues, from narcotics smuggling, weapons, and human trafficking to domestic and foreign terror attacks.", "As technology advances new threats emerge. Advanced technology has become an increasingly prevalent tool for radical/extremist groups to carry out threats against the US. With the world’s increasing reliance on technology, so too has the US’s reliance on technology for the operation of defense systems, natural resources management, and economic development. Disconcertedly, the heavy reliance on technology makes infrastructure itself susceptible to corruption and terror attacks from radical/extremist organizations. This vector poses a very viable threat to national security, one that requires a specific skill set to develop effective solutions to ongoing threats.", "Until recently most agencies defended their targeted national security issues independently without much interest in sharing intelligence with the rest of the law enforcement and intelligence community. These agencies run operations targeting these threats independently, meanwhile, other agencies may be conducting identical operations and targeting the same threats. Thus, both agencies are conducting and developing their own intelligence and investigative leads, without sharing this crucial information with the other agency. Bridging these communication gaps will help solidify a cohesive investigation to target these threats and the investment in collaborative task forces will better defend the nation from multiple national security threats stemming from radical/extremist groups.", "Most organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, do not solely threaten the US on one front. The Sinaloa Cartel’s illicit schemes encompass multiple national security issues in order to accomplish their overall goals. Though one of the most dangerous cartels in Mexico, they are still not considered a terrorist organization because their motives are financially-based, however, their actions still plague national security. In order to smuggle drugs into the US and secure power within Mexico, the Sinaloa Cartel must traffic humans, narcotics, weapons, and money to and from Mexico. The aforementioned crimes are national security issues investigated independently by numerous agencies from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Border Patrol, ICE Homeland Security Investigations to other state and local Law enforcement agencies. Greater collaborative or joint task forces could help bridge the intelligence and communications gap between agencies, as well as assist with jurisdictional concerns.", "Many agencies also face jurisdictional dilemmas involving the investigation and prosecution of subjects and their illicit activity. With collaborative efforts agencies like the Tucson Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations can better use their unique resources to develop a better intelligence picture which can lead to successful investigations charging subjects on a multi-jurisdictional level. Partnering the Border Patrol with ATF can assist with the investigating and prosecuting of the smuggling of humans and weapons, meanwhile partnering with the FBI can bridge intelligence gaps for potential terror threats.", "These partnerships can also encourage resource collaboration. The violence and the illicit activity along the southwest border far surpass the rest of the country. However, smaller agencies have not seen an increase in manpower in relation to the rising crime rates. Further, the majority of federal investigative agencies do not have the law enforcement personnel or the intelligence and enforcement resources needed to conduct the most comprehensive investigations. Larger agencies, like the Border Patrol and some State agencies, can provide the necessary resources needed to keep up with the larger more sophisticated organizations. Thus, combining these resources can enhance the ability for all law enforcement agencies to combat national security threats.", "Collaborative or joint task forces are becoming and will be the most proficient way to conduct law enforcement operations in the future. In addition to joint task forces, many agencies within the law enforcement community are establishing a new collaborative effort in intelligence fusions centers. A fusion center’s sole purpose is to share resources and de-conflict amongst partnering agencies. De-confliction conveys to investigative agencies that their investigations are not being pursued by other agencies.", "Ultimately, it is the goal of every agency is to ensure that the freedoms, safety, and democracy for all US citizens are preserved and protected against national security threats, and simply, this can be most effectively combatted through the means of collaboration."]}, {"id": 32037, "title": "Legal & Government Affairs", "content": ["Can you expand on any recent developments in social programs or initiatives that have been implemented in Offaly and how effective they have been?"]}, {"id": 32038, "title": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "content": ["You are working on a JavaScript application that utilizes the `createSelector` function from the Redux library.

Here it is that: “Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God; a new and definitive intervention by God, with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world” (GDC 101). First of all I just want to know if you have ever heard a more potent and powerful expression of the Kingdom of God, “with a transforming power equal and even superior to his creation of the world.” As you know salvation is the central message of the good news. “This is the great gift of God which is to be considered as comprising not merely liberation from all those things by which man is oppressed, but especially liberation from sin and from the domination of the evil one, a liberation which incorporates that gladness enjoyed by every man who knows God and is known by him, who sees God and who surrenders himself trustingly to him.” This is a good beginning point for what might discuss what would be an “intimate and vital bond of man to God,” so that is a starting point of departure and the scope of our conversion because not all people believe even in this very brief and limited view of the Gospel message proclaiming salvation which is liberation, but also an intimate relationship with God.", "According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

First, of these six just pick one and let me know which one you think most applies to you now or at one time in your life may have been a reason for not believing in the proclamation without getting into any other reasons which one of these do you think relates to you the most. I would actually say after thinking more about it; before I believed I related most to number 2: religious indifference and a good dash of number 3 the cares and riches of the world with a great heaping helping of personal sin. I was not rejecting the Gospel because I was somehow revolting against in the world as reason not to believe, nor did care about scandals or hypocrites. Maybe a little on the prevailing negativity or lack thereof positive towards religion. If I had order these from most likely my attitude was from most to least was 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1. Mainly, I was just indifferent to it all and didn’t know much of anything, so I really did not care and because of my cares for the world and the things it namely my sinful desires I did not take it seriously. Then of course, I would hide from God out of fear and to flee his call, which I did during the middle part of my journey of faith as I was learning to commit my life to him. I would say now if there is anything that might hinder my faith it could be a revolt against the evil in the world. It sounds strange that what was least important to me before I believed would now be something that I could see making it difficult to believe. I might even say that the scandal and bad example on part of believers could also cause me to struggle in my faith.

Unfortunately after a couple of minutes it came off after checking the hook the point had been pushed over maybe the hook caught the bony part of the fishes mouth or it hit a stone in the silt who knows but a fresh hook link was attached and put back out on the spot.

I just got back into my sleeping bag and the gully rod was off again, this time the waterproofs went on and I was into a better fish after it going under the other line and back over the other way the rods were untangled I had it in the net within minutes. It weighed 16lbs I was made up with the session so far only been fishing for 6hrs and having a few on the bank. I don’t normally do this but due to this rain lashing down I decided to not put the rod back out but the bait was still put out on the spot to keep them grubbing about. 2am the bar rod was away and it didn’t feel that big as it kept shaking its head left and right normally signalling a smaller fish. I was right a 11lb mirror. Same happened to this rod I re-baited but didn’t cast out, I set my alarm for 530am hoping the rain had stopped it hadn’t so I just sat up watching the water for any signs of fish over the spots. 7am arrived and plenty of tea consumed and the rain stopped but I hadn’t seen any fish I put the rods back on the spots, the weather had warmer up a lot it was now 9 degrees at 830am. I kept looking for any signs of fish activity but none, by 9am nothing so the rods came in and I went for a wander around the lake as I knew the fish were in the shallower water by now making the most of the December sun.

Due the weather still being warm all day and night we set up in the middle of the lake with depths of 5 to 6ft in front of us. My rods were cast out on spots that I have been fishing this year. My rigs were 7inch -combi rigs with a snowman, the only difference here is that I use the Vor-Tex topped with the signature pop ups in pink and white. 20 freebies were put over the top of each rod.", "The afternoon and night passed without any signs of any fish or bleeps on the alarm, I woke up at midnight and set my alarm for 530am to hopefully hear something. If I didn’t I was going to up sticks and move down to the shallow end. Around 6ish I heard some carp crashing out but as it’s still dark I couldn’t quite see where they were but I knew they weren’t too far away from one of my spots. I decided to fire out a dozen more boilies over both rods due to the amount of bream in this lake. At 10am the right rod that was near the crashing carp was away signalled a slow steady take, after guiding it away from the last remaining pads the mirror was safely in the net. It weighed 15.10 after looking at the scale pattern I realised I caught the same fish 3 weeks earlier from the same swim. After speaking to the bailiff this was the first fish out of here since I last caught this fish. A brew was made and I was scanning the water for signs of fish, I decided to put both rods on the spot where I had caught the fish from to see if they were held up there. After an hour or so after I moved the rod I saw a fish poke its head out over my original spot so the rod was wound in quickly and put on the spot where the fish had shown itself. 15 minutes later the rod was off and the fish was trying to head for the pads. Keeping steady pressure the fish was out of harm’s way and playing about under the rod tip. The mirror weighed 13.8lbs a few snaps were taken and it was released back.

We all know the old cliché that the National Rifle Association has power because its members vote on the guns issue, while gun-control people aren’t zealots. Well, Wayne LaPierre and 46 craven senators, that “majority” of the Senate, have just created millions of zealots, and as furious as I am, I’m also strangely at peace, because I’m more confident than ever that the NRA will never, ever be stronger in Washington than it was yesterday.", "Historians will see this recent debate, culminating in yesterday’s vote, as the time when the gun-control lobby grew and coalesced. The gun issue, since the 1970s a blunt instrument used mainly to bully rural-state Democrats, is going to start turning into the opposite: pressure on blue- and purple-state Republicans to vote at least for modest measures. And make no mistake, what the Senate voted on yesterday was modest; far too modest, in that we can’t even discuss banning the online sale of limitless amounts of ammunition. The NRA won this one, but as President Obama said in some of the most passionate remarks of his public life yesterday evening, this is just “round one.” More rounds are coming, and the balance of power is going to change.", "You cannot oppose the will of 90 percent of the public and expect no consequences.

Begich and Pryor, who face reelection next year, have the least lame excuses of all, but they are cowards too. They have to know they did the wrong thing. If Joe Manchin could do what he did—and trust me, I’m from West Virginia, and I know Joe, and our families knew each other, and the whole thing.

We’ll see how that goes in time. I hope, in 2017, we don’t see him suddenly carrying the NRA’s water. But I don’t think so. I think once you leave the church, you leave. He’s like Keanu Reeves at the end of The Devil’s Advocate. He has left Satan’s embrace. Much credit is due Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, too. I don’t know whether a Republican primary is now headed his way in 2016, but as right wing as he is on virtually every issue, he at least stepped forward and tried to be a legislator.", "Obama’s words were the most powerful he’s delivered in years. Call it failed if you want, but this was leadership: knowing that he was probably going to lose on the Hill, but putting everything he had into the fight anyway. He took on not only the NRA and its whores in Congress, he took on the blasé complacency of a pundit class that said repeatedly: he’ll never win, so why do this; he should have struck while the iron was hot; he should have talked to Republicans more. Yes, it was clear that a challenge to the NRA was likely to lose, but that isn’t what always should dictate a politician’s actions. He behaved out of conviction. This is rare enough among politicians that Obama certainly should not be nitpicked for this or that little thing he did or didn’t do.", "This was one of the blackest days in the Senate’s history.

Well, that little boy at the Sandy Hook school who got his jaw blown clean off, whose unimaginably brave mother insisted on an open casket so people would have to deal with the reality of what guns can do, had civil rights too, the first one of which is safety in his person. So did his classmates and teachers, and so did the hundreds, thousands of victims, a train of corpses that could stretch around the world, silenced in life, and silenced again yesterday by Mitch McConnell and 45 other people who now have a little bit of those victims’ blood splattered on their hands.

Pritchard said. This is a great premise to hold onto while writing a short story; stories are a window into a life, not the whole enchilada.", "These five tips for making sure you’re creating enough conflict to keep your reader turning the pages may seem like basics, but I still use them as good reminders about what’s crucial to writing an engaging short story. Often, I’ll write an entire draft and forget about a few of these necessary elements. But always, they show themselves through many revisions, as they are always necessary to make a story really sing.", "1. Have your character want something.", "Your character needs to be presented in a way that they desire something, but they do not have it yet. It can be a possession, a person, even a trip to somewhere. In the title story of my book, Alina is stalking her daughter’s boyfriend in a creepy way. In the first paragraph we learn she is outside the boyfriend’s apartment every morning, in the afternoons she’s at the coffee shop when he gets his cup of joe, she’s hoping he’ll be haunted by her presence.", "He is the reason her daughter is in trouble, the story declares. I wrote this line after many revisions, as I knew I had to be upfront about the conflict in the story. In this way, the reader wants to find out what the guy did to her daughter and feels empathy for the mother in the situation.", "To know a character is to know what they want, and the story follows that pursuit.", "2. Create a situation that involves danger.", "Any kind of danger, from seeing a suspicious text on a spouse’s phone to being caught in a bank robbery. The tension of that situation is what carries the story forward and becomes its anchor. Unlike novels, every sentence in a short story has to involve developing the plot or revealing more about the character. In revision, I tend to move paragraphs and reshape the way a story unfolds, not unlike rearranging furniture in a room. I cut big chunks that don’t need to be there, like taking out that old sofa you love, but in the end, it has to go. In my story, “How I Became A Banker,” the first line is, When I was twelve I made a promise to myself that I’d make a shitload of money. The reader immediately wants to know why the narrator made such a promise and at such a young age. Again, I didn’t come to this line until after many revisions.", "3. Conjure up complications.", "Whatever the situation you create, add some complication to it: Nicola is tempted to flirt with the tattoo artist and does so, and then discovers that the tattoo artist’s assistant is an old school buddy of her boyfriend. She flirts because she is determined to ruin her life, her goal is self-destruction, not messing up her relationship. It’s complicated and sorrowful and the reader is hooked. Be on the lookout for plots that surprise you. It’s usually a good thing.", "4. Hide the real problem.", "“It’s not the mud on the floor,” my mother used to say. She meant it as a metaphor for when things go wrong and it seems it’s one thing that’s bothering a person, but it’s usually something else. For example, in my story “You’re Here Now,” Sylvie has never met her father, but she’s on the way to his funeral. The story seems to be about the loss of ever having a relationship with her father, but the reader soon realizes the story is about the resentment she has toward her mother, who never let her see her father or his large family. It’s the hidden thing, the complication behind what is initially presented that can make stories so rich.", "5. Make sure the readers know the trouble early, like a few paragraphs in.", "It’s almost a cliché to say write a story and then delete the first two pages to get to the “heat” or “pulse” of it.", "In Flannery O'Connor's famous story \"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\" the first line gives trouble that seems minor, though it will lead to the catastrophe at the end: The grandmother didn't want to go to Florida.

Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare.

Suggestions that they were the direct descendants of theropod dinosaurs (a group of bipedal meat-eaters that include Allosaurus, Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus) caused quite a flap. Today, most researchers agree that birds are, indeed, a branch of the Dinosauria. How they made the transition from the land to the sky, though, has yet to be agreed. But a paper in this week's Current Biology, by Christopher Glen and Michael Bennett of the University of Queensland, makes a strong case that they did it by jumping.", "Considering the diversity of life on Earth, flight is surprisingly rare. It has evolved only four times: among the insects about 300m years ago, the pterosaurs (230m), the birds (150m) and the bats (50m). That suggests it is a hard trick to pull off. For birds, there is general agreement that feathers came before flight. Fossils from north-eastern China show animals that had feathers but clearly could not have flown, as well as ones that look like proper birds. The best guesses are that feathers evolved either for insulation (as fur did in mammals) or for display, and that natural selection took advantage by turning them into a means of transport.", "There are two broad schools of thought about what happened next. One argues that birds' immediate ancestors lived in trees. Members of this school think that powered flight developed as a natural extension of gliding (such controlled falling is used as a way of travelling from tree to tree by several arboreal species today). Gliding itself developed because of the lift provided by feathered forearms.", "The alternative is that flight evolved on the ground. Some researchers who belong to this school of thought suggest that the power provided by flapping protowings may have given their owners an edge in the pursuit of prey. Others hypothesise that feathery forearms helped animals steer and stabilise themselves.", "Unfortunately, behaviour does not fossilise, so it looked as though the question might never be answered. But Dr Glen, a palaeobiologist, and Dr Bennett, a biomechanic, think they have worked out how to do so. Their crucial observation is that in modern birds the curvature of the third toe (which carries a lot of weight during walking and climbing) varies with species' lifestyles. Birds that spend lots of time climbing around on the trunks of trees have dramatically curved third toes. Those that hop around on branches have mildly curved ones. Those that forage mainly on the ground have the least curved of all.", "The two researchers compared these observations with their findings for the bird-like dinosaurs and dinosaur-like birds of China. They noticed that the toes of both feathered dinosaurs and of the earliest flying birds were similar to those of modern birds that spend most of their time on the ground. Flight, in other words, came before birds took to the trees. They are not fallen angels, but risen reptiles.", "A: feathers evolved not for a means of transport.", "B: it is very hard to have such evolution.", "C: life on earth is diversified.", "D: many species of this kind were eliminated during evolution."]}, {"id": 32580, "title": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "content": ["Who are you?"]}, {"id": 32581, "title": "Literature & Cinema", "content": ["\"Content Warning: This work of fiction contains mature themes, explicit sexual content, graphic violence, and strong language.

With a 2016 homicide rate of ~29 per 100,000, Chicago’s homicide rate hasn’t reached the 1992 peak of ~32 per 100,000. Can anyone recall CBS comparing Chicago to a “war zone” in the 1990s?", "60 Minutes centered its coverage on a drop in stops and arrests by police, with a focus on blaming the police for creating a crime-filled environment, with scarce mention of the perpetrators behind the increase in violent crime.

Nowhere is this more pertinent than Chicago, a large city with a massive gang and criminal element centered in a few bad neighborhoods.", "If there is ever to be any meaningful police reform, race should not be the focus. Reforming our for-profit criminal justice system is a great place to start instead. The majority of police activity is profit-based, not crime-based – just think about the number of cops writing speeding tickets who could instead be solving crimes. Making profound changes to an overmilitarized police force is necessary, as countless people of all races are illegally surveilled, wrongfully arrested, have their personal property seized, sometimes in unnecessary SWAT raids, and all of this police conduct is totally tolerated by the MSM. Real reform in the war on drugs, which is driving a large amount of this activity, needs to be done for any other reforms to be effective. Holding police accountable for their mistakes is but one piece of a much larger puzzle to solve regarding police reform.", "At least 60 Minutes finally got something correct this time around in their reporting. They did not blame gun laws as the problem for Chicago’s violence. That is quite a turnabout, given the program’s history in blaming gun laws for all gun violence in the USA.

These wastes are commonly called lignocellulosic wastes that are a source of value-added products. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) for bioconversion of lignocellulosic waste, which produces various bioproducts, has economic and environmental advantages. The lignocellulosic compounds are biorenewable and most plentiful resource on earth that can be utilized for manufacturing value-added products. Furthermore, the use of lignocellulosic, starchy, and other agro-industrial by-products in the manufacture of these biomolecules has yet to be thoroughly investigated. As a result, there is a vast opportunity for the development of cost-effective, sustainable biorefining technologies. The main components of lignocellulosic biomass used in biorefineries are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. To obtain final biobased products, these components must be processed through a series of procedures that include pretreatments, enzymatic hydrolysis, and fermentation. Biotechnology techniques and process engineering are critical in developing integrated processes for producing various value-added products from lignocellulosic biomass, including biofuels, biochemicals, bioactive substances, enzymes, and biomaterials. This review focuses on the valorization potential of lignocellulosic, palm oil mill, brewing, and dairy biomass produced as agri-food industrial by-products for developing biobased products in the biorefinery scenario. It is the first review of its kind to include variety of products that can be derived from different wastes encircling all the pros and cons of current technology and focusing on future improvements.”", "Now, take the role of an expert consultant for the edible oils industry.

The trials are intended to find skilled individuals who are deemed worthy of the mastermind organization so they can do their bidding, and consist of activities humiliating and degrading people. The game I am making now is the aftermath of the Gladiator Trials. the survivors of the prequel trials come in. They are traumatized by the trials but they don't have any power to go back home. There are two groups of survivors who are all being controlled by the mastermind organization: The Gladiators are people who passed all the trials and now work as mercenaries who are clueless as to whom they were working under and who kidnapped them in the first place. They just know they need to work as mercenaries for the 6 nations (the world they are in now) and eventually earn the trust of the nation's nobles because that's what the organization wants, and they know how to get them back home. The Renegades consist of those who failed the trials but were skilled enough to be worthy of the organization's attention and are technically given a second chance. They want to go home but don't know how. They also see that most of the nation's nobles are very corrupt, and are upset with the Gladiators for protecting them (the organization intentionally prevents the gladiators from seeing the corruption of each noble, so the gladiators also retaliate). Also, the Renegades don't think they are under the organization's control since they failed the trial and are no longer of any importance, however, the organization has moles in both teams, so they have more control.", "There is only one storyline, however, there are multiple playable main characters that each have different perspectives on the events that occur in the story.

The other two playable characters are secret unlockables and are the true protagonists of the game, as they are a unique take on trickster gods. More specifically, they have many mental and emotional instabilities and are physically compromised, but they also suddenly have amnesia which messes with the organization's data of them and makes them unpredictable. These two characters are also very powerful, one of them is very physically strong, and the other is a tactical engineering genius.
