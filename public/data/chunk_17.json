A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says.

It is a big raise to counter a striking anomaly: in recent years snooker has gone 147‑loopy everywhere bar the world championship.\nThe basics of the snooker maximum require a player to make a clean sweep of the table, with every red that is potted being followed by a black. Established in the 1870s, with the first world championship taking place in 1927, snooker’s first recorded maximum came in 1955. It was scored by Joe Davis, the 15‑times world champion, and took two years before it was officially recognised. The first maximum in professional competition, meanwhile, did not come until 1982 when Steve Davis made the score in the Lada Classic in Oldham. To commemorate his accomplishment Davis was presented with a Lada with the customised numberplate of SD 147.\nThe story of the snooker maximum accelerated from that point. To date there have been 139 scores of 147 in professional snooker. Of that total 70 have come since the turn of the decade and three have come in the past four weeks. The Chinese player Liang Wenbo scored one in world championship qualifying and nearly reached another two frames later, only to fail on the final black.\nO’Sullivan has the most 147s of any player, 14. The total includes the most feted maximum of all, scored against Mick Price in the first round of the 1997 world championship, a feat which took five minutes and 20 seconds to complete. When Sullivan made that break he was rewarded with a bonus of £147,000. Given the increasing frequency of the achievement, it is perhaps not surprising the prize money shrank. But there has not been a maximum at the world championship since Stephen Hendry cleaned the table against Stuart Bingham in 2012. The appetite to see an end to the barren run even led to O’Sullivan being suspected of having swerved one on purpose last year. Potting a pink after the final red when – in some eyes – it was possible for him to have screwed back for the black, Sullivan’s actions were deemed a protest against the insubstantial prize pot.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: When was the first recorded maximum in snooker and who achieved it?"}, {"id": 2627, "actor": "Cooking & Healthy Eating", "prompt": "Create a comprehensive and detailed menu of unique burger toppings that can be easily customized to cater to various dietary restrictions and preferences.

Answer according to: Julie Nelson and Nancy Hedin of the Moose Lake Post Prom Committee requested a donation from the Moose Lake City Council at its meeting Wednesday, April 8. The council members approved a $300 donation from the newly-formed contribution fund approved earlier this year. This is the first donation from the fund, which receives funding from pull-tabs at the Moose Lake Municipal Liquor Store. This year's outing will be held at Mont du Lac Chalet in the east Duluth area. Dave Johnson, during the public comment section of the meeting, spoke about his concerns regarding tax increment financing and the possible construction of new apartments in Moose Lake. He expressed concerns that what the city needs is more jobs, not tax increment financing for new apartments. He stated concerns that taxes on his Lake Shore Manor apartments and the Paul Rouche apartments have risen dramatically. He said he has no concern with conventional buildings going up without tax increment financing, but wants to see businesses that will offer jobs in the city. Rich Maxfield, superintendent of Moose Lake Power and Light, spoke to the council regarding the upcoming electrical line work that will be done in Moose Lake. The power lines that run from Douglas Avenue to Birch Avenue, between 3rd Street and 5th Street will be removed and replaced with underground lines. A transformer box will be located on 4th Street just west of Birch. Pedestals will be placed on 4th and 5th, with one pedestal servicing two homes. The pedestals will be placed on the property line near the street. The underground wiring will be pulled through electrical piping and will not disturb the property located at these sites. Brian Weidenforf of Land and Lease, developer of Moose Lake's Opportunity Park, spoke with the council regarding wetland credits and water/sewer piping. Weidendorf has been meeting with Carlton County regarding a wetland credits purchase, instead of Moose Lake wetland credits. However, he is able to use 8-inch ductile iron pipe (DIP) that Moose Lake has in storage. Weidendorf, City Administrator Pat Oman and the council are negotiating the costs of streetlights for the Opportunity Park project. The city wants decorative streetlights to match Arrowhead Lane. Weidendorf is willing to pay for regular street lighting, if the city is willing to pay the extra cost for special street lighting. Discussions will continue. A discussion was held regarding a letter received from Kwik Trip regarding the convenience store it is planning to construct at Opportunity Park. The letter addresses the planned construction of a storm water pond for the proposed site. There will be certain storm water features that will be incorporated into the site by Kwik Trip, to provide proper handling of storm water. A new pipe outfall will be constructed that will carry the majority of the storm water from the site. A sump catch basin manhole equipped with a SNOUT oil/water separator will be used for storm water draining from the fueling areas to provide pretreatment of storm water prior to discharging to the pond. A meeting regarding rural aging was held on March 26 at the home of Rita Baresh to discuss issues facing the elderly in the city of Moose Lake. Transportation was listed as one of the top priorities. A White House listening session is set for Thursday, May 14 from 2:30-5 p.m. at the depot community center. It will be a listening session and people can come, give their input, and then leave. Catherine Sampson of the Arrowhead Area Agency on Aging is setting up the session. Mayor Ted Shaw attended the meeting and brought the information to the council. Council members discussed transportation for the elderly and the feasibility of a bus system within Moose Lake. This has been done previously, but was stopped in 2008 because there was only one person using the service. The council will discuss this idea further at its next meeting. Joe Rhein, city engineer, and Brian Guldan, environment project engineer, spoke regarding the wastewater treatment facility upgrades. The city had previously approved upgrades to the current system. However, Guldan spoke to the council regarding the addition of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to the wastewater facility treatment project. SCADA consists of hardware, software and communication systems that can control, monitor and log data for the lift stations and various other types of processes in the water and wastewater treatment facility. Maxfield stated SCADA was used in Wilmar with excellent results. City personnel can access the data from smart phones or tablets to determine what needs to be done, and program the changes that need to be made from their phone or tablet. SCADA will save approximately 1.5 man-hours every day. The system was approved by the council. The council also approved the addition of a stand-alone, diesel-powered backup generator for the new lift stations. The generator would prevent any backup of sewage during power outages in the community. Approval was given for the purchase and installation of diaper changing stations in the men’s and women’s bathrooms in the public area by the library in the city building. The next regular meeting of the Moose Lake City Council will be held on Wednesday, May 13 at 6:30 p.m. in the city council chamber."}, {"id": 2637, "actor": "Job Application & Customer Management", "prompt": "Write a heartfelt letter to a specific team member that includes specific examples of their hard work that you appreciated.

The shield was adorned with the emblem of his family - a golden lion on a field of blue.\n## The Castle and Dragon's Lair\nThe castle where the princess was held captive was on the top of a high mountain, surrounded by dense forests and treacherous ravines. The dragon's lair was in a cave deep in the heart of the mountain. It was said that the dragon had been terrorizing the countryside for years, devouring everything in its path.\n## The Challenges\nThe journey to the castle was treacherous, and Sir Lancelot faced many challenges along the way. He had to cross a rickety old bridge over a raging river, fight off a band of marauding bandits, and climb a steep mountain pass.\n## The Battle\nWhen Sir Lancelot finally arrived at the castle, he found the dragon waiting for him. The dragon was huge, with scales as hard as steel and eyes that glowed like embers. Sir Lancelot drew his sword and charged at the dragon. The battle was fierce and lasted for hours. In the end, it was Sir Lancelot's magical sword that saved the day. With one mighty blow, he struck the dragon's heart and it fell to the ground, dead.\n## The Princess\nThe princess was overjoyed to see Sir Lancelot, and she threw her arms around him. They quickly made their way back to the castle, where the king and queen were waiting. They welcomed Sir Lancelot as a hero and threw a great feast in his honor. The princess and Sir Lancelot fell in love, and they were married soon after.

In this question, we implement a function in MATLAB that generates a column vector containing a sine wave with a growing frequency, also known as a chirp tone.\n\nThe function that we will create is called chirpTone, and it takes four inputs: the duration T in seconds, the initial frequency f1 in Hz, the final frequency f2 in Hz, and the sampling rate fs in samples per second. The output of the function is a column vector output containing a chirp tone with the specified parameters.\n\nTo generate the chirp tone, we first need to define the time vector t using the sampling rate fs. We can do this by dividing the duration T into fs equally spaced time intervals, or samples, using the sampling period ts=1/fs. This will give us a time vector t ranging from 0 to T with length(t) samples.\n\nNext, we need to define the frequency vector f that grows linearly from f1 to f2 over the duration of the chirp tone. We can do this using the formula f = f1 + (f2-f1)/(length(t)-1) \\* (0:length(t)-1). This formula creates a frequency vector f with the same length as the time vector t, where the first element is f1 and the last element is f2, with the intermediate values growing linearly over time.\n\nFinally, we can generate the chirp tone output by taking the sine of the product of 2πf(t) and t, where f(t) is the frequency vector we just defined. We can do this using the formula output = sin(2\\*pi\\*f.\\*t).\n\nTo test our function, we can call it with the desired inputs and store the output in a variable x. For example, x = chirpTone(10,1000,2000,4000) generates a chirp tone with a duration of 10 seconds, starting at 1000 Hz and ending at 2000 Hz, sampled at 4000 samples per second.
