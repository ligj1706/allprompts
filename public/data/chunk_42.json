Two weeks ago, we touched on how living behind the masks of who we think we are supposed to be can become our identity and that it keeps our light hidden. Last week we discussed boundaries – and becoming clear on our values, what is important to us, and sharing them with others creates space for our authentic selves to be expressed and known – clarifying our boundaries can build bridges through dialogue. \n\nToday we gather to explore some barriers that keep us from fully embracing our true selves.\n\nAs we navigate our journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth, we may encounter feelings of shame and unworthiness that prevent us from living our most authentic lives.\nThere is no way to talk about authenticity without addressing the elephant in the room: feelings of shame and unworthiness – which can keep us from even doing this work. Shame is universal in the human experience. It is the feeling that we are “not enough.” It is a fear of being unlovable that convinces us that if we work harder, change ourselves, keep some parts hidden from others and maybe, when we finally become enough, we will then be worthy of love and connection with others.\n\nLearning what shame is and what triggers shame for us, we will be able to recognize it and move through it with our worthiness. Shame can become a guide for us to the areas that we do not yet love and accept ourselves. It is in those areas we are seeking our worth through the approval of others. \n\nSWAN: Once upon a time, there was a beautiful swan that grew up amongst a flock of ducks. The swan had always felt different, unworthy, and ashamed, as it could not fit in with the ducks around it. It had been told all its life that it was an ugly duckling and that it would never be good enough.\n\nOne day, the swan came across a calm lake where it saw its reflection for the first time. To its surprise, it saw a beautiful, majestic swan staring back. In that moment, it realized that it had never been an ugly duckling; it was a swan, deserving of love and acceptance just as it was. This revelation allowed the swan to let go of the shame and unworthiness it had carried for so long and to embrace its true, authentic self.\n\nLike the swan, we all have inherent worth, as we are made in the image and likeness of the Divine. \n\nErnest Holmes writes, \"You belong to the universe in which you live, you are one with the Creative Genius back of this vast array of ceaseless motion, this original flow of life\" (This Thing Called You, Pg 3). Our worthiness is our birthright, and it is not dependent on external factors or the approval of others.\n\nHowever, shame and unworthiness can manifest in various ways and keep us from embracing our authentic selves. \nBrene Brown states, \"Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging\" (The Gifts of Imperfection, Pg. 39).\n\nHow do shame or unworthiness can prevent us from living authentically? \n1. Fear of expressing our true emotions: Shame may cause us to suppress our emotions and hide our authentic selves, fearing judgment or ridicule from others. \n2. Struggling with self-care: When we feel unworthy, we may neglect our physical, emotional, and mental well-being, believing that we don't deserve self-care. This can lead to burnout, exhaustion, and a disconnection from our authentic selves.\n3. Seeking validation from others: A sense of shame or unworthiness can cause us to rely on the approval and validation of others, rather than trusting our own instincts and values. This can result in inauthentic behavior, as we strive to please others and meet their expectations instead of living true to ourselves.\n\nTo release shame and unworthiness and embrace our authentic selves, we must first recognize and acknowledge these feelings. And for this reason we are discuss this today.\n\nErnest Holmes explains, \"When you stop condemning yourself, the condemnation of others will not reach you\" (New Horizons, 7). It's essential to confront these emotions, process them, and ultimately let them go.\n\nWhat are some actions we can take to help us release shame and unworthiness and embrace your authentic self. This morning I’ll offer you 4 as a starting place to support you:\n1. Create an inventory of your triggers: Awareness is the first step in transforming these feelings and reclaiming your power. Recognizing and understanding what triggers feelings of shame and unworthiness within you can help you face them head-on. \n2. Share your story with a trusted person: Brene Brown puts it, \"Shame needs three things to grow out of control in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgment… We need to share our experience; shame loses power when it is spoken\" (The Gifts of Imperfection, Pg. 40). Opening up about your feelings of shame and unworthiness to someone you trust can be a healing and empowering experience. In 12 step recovery, there is the 5th step where, “Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.” This vital exercise begins to provide emotional, mental and spiritual relief. By sharing wrong with a trusted confidant, guilt and shame start to melt away. \n3. Practice self-awareness and self-compassion: Mindfulness and meditation can help us develop greater self-awareness and foster self-compassion, and equanimity. Through understanding and embracing all aspects of yourself, including the parts you may feel ashamed or unworthy of, you can begin to cultivate authenticity and inner strength.\n4. Affirm your worthiness: Regularly remind yourself of your inherent worth through affirmations, such as \"I am worthy. I am loved. I am enough.\" Say this with me….This practice can help you internalize a sense of worthiness and reinforce your self-confidence.\n\nReleasing feelings of shame and unworthiness is a crucial step in embracing our authentic selves and living a life in alignment with our true nature. As we recognize, confront and process these emotions, we open ourselves up to a deeper sense of self-love, self-acceptance, and personal power.\n\nPrem Prakash, \"Our stresses, anxieties, pains, and problems arise because we do not see the world, others, or even ourselves as worthy of love\" (The Yoga of Spiritual Devotion: A Modern Translation of the Narada Bhakti Sutras). \n\nBy recognizing our inherent worthiness and shedding the shame and unworthiness that hold us back, we can fully embrace our authentic selves and live a life of love, connection, and joy.\n\nMay we all continue to support one another on this journey, and may we find the courage and strength to live our most authentic lives."}, {"id": 6341, "actor": "Prime Numbers & Mathematical Symbols", "prompt": "34591+321542452"}, {"id": 6342, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "List five specific techniques that designers can implement to optimize the accessibility of their designs for users with varying needs, such as color-blindness, hearing impairments, and mobility limitations.

Failing to seed the capability now will have an adverse impact like - increase in cost n effort outlays, higher time to detect/repair, poor user experiences, lack of analytics to facilitate decision-making etc. AI can support three important business needs: engaging with employees, automating business processes and gaining insight through data analysis.\n\nKey tech trends, possibilities that Al impacts in CCD services:\n• Al at the DX edge - Transforming Digital {perience service touch points to Al-first manage[1]at-scale & BoT-first interaction approach than people/effort-first led service\no #: Thanks to natural language processing and generation, Al-powered machines can be used to communicate with users with conversational Al in Contact center/Conversational AI, Collab/SDSk platform BoTs etc. In fact, service/messaging chatbots are now pretty much mainstream and these Al models need quality talent to iteratively improve fine-tuning via learning/training.\n• Faster to Smarter Intelligence - Building Self-healing/Self-supervised, Cognitive, Failure[l]prediction & Autonomous management capabilities\n• # AIOps: for superior efficiencies, reducing mean-time-to-diagnose and repair processing ML on logs/unstructured data that CCD is entrusted with. o #: No0pS: Leveraging Al for autonomous WLAN, automating DB Ops, ML-driven insights on Unified Logging, LCNC Al etc eliminating/minimizing Ops tasks/routines/interventions for service performance \n• o #: Predictive maintenance/Modeling are other advanced levels of AI [1] \nI l\noptimized process perf.

Your task is to understand the logic behind this code and write a function that accomplishes the same task.\n\nThe code snippet provided calculates `ans` based on the following rules:\n\n1. Initialize `ans` to 1.\n2. Initially, set the previous differential (`d_p`) and current differential (`d_c`) to 0.\n3. Iterate through a range of `n` elements.\n4. For each iteration:\n   a. Update `d_c` by adding the current element (`ll[i]`) to the previous differential (`d_p`).\n   b. If `d_c` is less than or equal to a given value `x`, increment `ans` by 1.\n   c. Set `d_p` to `d_c` for the next iteration.\n5. After iterating through all elements, `ans` holds the required value.\n\nYou need to implement a function `calculate_ans(n: int, x: int, ll: List[int]) -> int` that takes in three parameters:\n- `n` (1 <= n <= 10^6) - the number of elements in the list `ll`.\n- `x` (0 <= x <= 1000) - the maximum value allowed for `d_c`.\n- `ll` (length(ll) = n) - a list of integers representing the elements.\n\nThe function should return the calculated value for `ans`.\n\nFor example, given `n = 4`, `x = 5`, and `ll = [2, 0, 3, 1]`, the function should return `4` because:\n- On the first iteration, `d_c = 0 + 2 = 2`, which is less than or equal to `x`. So, `ans` becomes `2`.\n- On the second iteration, `d_c = 2 + 0 = 2`, which is less than or equal to `x`. So, `ans` becomes `3`.\n- On the third iteration, `d_c = 2 + 3 = 5`, which is equal to `x`. So, `ans` becomes `4`.\n- On the fourth iteration, `d_c = 5 + 1 = 6`, which is greater than `x`. So, `ans` remains `4`.\n\nYour task is to implement the function `calculate_ans` and return the final value of `ans`."}, {"id": 6411, "actor": "Tabletop Role-Playing Games & Star Wars Themed Adventures", "prompt": "what is roblox and why do so many kids go to it?"}, {"id": 6412, "actor": "Tabletop Role-Playing Games & Star Wars Themed Adventures", "prompt": "Explain what is the concept of 'zero-sum game'"}, {"id": 6413, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "The file “STAT8010\\_2022\\_assignment2.csv” contains data for your second assignment.

Your first task is to implement an algorithm that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a given list of integers. The mean is the average of all the numbers in the list, the median is the middle number when the list is sorted in ascending order, and the mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. However, there is a catch - you are not allowed to use any built-in functions or libraries for calculating these statistics.\n\nWrite a function `calculate_stats(numbers)` that takes in a list of integers as a parameter and returns a dictionary containing the mean, median, and mode of the given numbers.\n\n**Function Signature**\n`def calculate_stats(numbers: List[int]) -> Dict[str, Union[float, int]]:`\n\n**Input**\nThe `numbers` parameter is a list of at least one integer and at most 1000 integers (-10^9 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 10^9).\n\n**Output**\nThe function should return a dictionary with three keys: \"mean\", \"median\", and \"mode\". The values corresponding to each key should be the calculated mean (float), median (int), and mode (int) respectively.\n\n**Examples**\nSuppose the following inputs are given:\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]\n```\nThe function should return:\n```python\n{\n  \"mean\": 4.0,\n  \"median\": 4,\n  \"mode\": 5\n}\n```\n\nSuppose the following inputs are given:\n```python\nnumbers = [3, 1, 2, 2, 4, 3]\n```\nThe function should return:\n```python\n{\n  \"mean\": 2.5,\n  \"median\": 2,\n  \"mode\": 2\n}\n```\n\n**Note**\nIn the first example, the mean is calculated as (1+2+3+4+5+5+6)/7 = 26/7 ≈ 4.0, the median is the middle number when the list is sorted in ascending order, which is 4, and the mode is 5 since it appears twice which is more than any other number.\n\nIn the second example, the mean is calculated as (3+1+2+2+4+3)/6 = 15/6 = 2.5, the median is 2 because it is the middle number, and the mode is 2 since it appears twice, which is more than any other number."}, {"id": 6442, "actor": "Mathematics & Algebra", "prompt": "The diagonals of kite WXYZ intersect at P.

The patterns dictionary is a nested dictionary with the following structure:\n\n```\nglobal_patterns = {\n    'type1': {\n        'pattern1': [row1, row2, ...],\n        'pattern2': [row1, row2, ...],\n        ...\n    },\n    'type2': {\n        'pattern1': [row1, row2, ...],\n        'pattern2': [row1, row2, ...],\n        ...\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, each pattern type is a key in the outer dictionary, and its value is another dictionary. The inner dictionary contains patterns as keys and associated rows as values, stored in a list.\n\nYour task is to complete the code snippet by opening the `outfile` and writing the global patterns dictionary to it in the following format:\n\n```\ntype1\npattern1: row1, row2, ...\npattern2: row1, row2, ...\n\ntype2\npattern1: row1, row2, ...\npattern2: row1, row2, ...\n...\n```\n\nEnsure that the patterns are sorted in lexicographical order, and each pattern's rows are sorted as well.
