Look (My Color Grading Workflow) - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"so I've been taking the fx30 with me everywhere to test out its fullest potential I've taken it to Korea Taiwan and Mexico to capture memories and also used it on Commercial work as well and surprisingly this camera can do 99 of what the fx3 can do at least from a use case you get better low light on the fx3 but other than that the fx30 still competes pretty hard with the fx3 the potential coming out of this camera is just amazing for its price so today I want to share how I color grade and how you can make the footage look beautiful coming from the fx30 [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign happy 2023 to everyone my name is Victor and today we're going to go through how I color grade my fx30 footage and first we're going to go through all the settings and that is the h265 format internally which is the xavc HS the reason why I use the HS format is because one it is a mix of Both Worlds of the S and the s i meaning that it is compressed and also it gives you a better quality image in terms of the recording format from your camera now one of the biggest requirements for this is to have an editing machine that has an h.265 accelerator that means it's a media encoder and decoder so that it really processes it fast on your editing machine and specifically what I use is an M1 Pro base model 16 inch MacBook Pro and I have a 16 gig RAM and that's all that I need if you don't have a machine that has a media accelerator for h.264 or h.265 I suggest using the SI format because it's going to give you the most uncompressed footage from your camera but that means that it's going to give you larger file size but it also is easier on your editing machine because your machine doesn't need to always decode and encode the files while you're editing now let's talk about exposure for the fx30 and the fx3 I use cine EI mode on EI 400 on the base ISO 800 90 of the time night time and daytime I usually leave it at zero on the metering so that I have a good range on the shadows and also a good range on the highlights now if you're using an a74 or something that doesn't have a cine EI shooting mode or if you just want to use flexible ISO mode that's just sticking to the base isos of your camera on slog3 and for my cameras the fx30 and the a74 that is 800 base ISO and then for the fx30 2500 it is the second base ISO and for the a74 is 3200 second base ISO just going to give you a better dynamic range doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to get rid of all the noise but it would have the cleanest image from both of those base isos and in terms of metering I usually just expose it from 0 to plus one and then I get similar results with the cine EI mode that's everything you need to know before you get into color grading really nailing the settings and the exposure first before you push your color grade is a big must okay let's start off with footage from Mexico this is the Cenote scene it's going to look like this in the beginning you don't have anything we're going to turn off the effects and we're gonna do the clip here so that we have more real estate for the video okay so I'm gonna apply my VL workflow right here so that my node structures are here and node structure is similar to the layer structure it's just a little different than layers I like the nose structure better but if you're editing in Premiere Pro or Final Cut you might have to work with layers and kind of understand just how you arrange everything so this is the bottom and this is all the way to the top okay on here let's start with the CSD I'm gonna use my own personal Lut which is the film Lut you don't need to use my Luts you can use CSD in here let me guys show you the freeway of utilizing this one you go CST and then we're gonna look for Sony s-log S gamut three dot cine and then the s-log 3 and then what we're going to do is output color space as Rec 709 and same thing with this one Rec 709 and we're just going to turn this on perfect and this is kind of like how you would normally do it and if you've shot everything on s stock 3 you can actually just disable this or delete that node and go to Project settings and once you go to Project settings you go to input lookup table and then we're gonna find s-log 3 S gamma 3. cine2lc minus 709 and it's pretty much going to be the same thing and it's just going to apply it to all of your footage instead of you manually doing it on every footage so since I've developed my own Luts I'm going to use it because I love using my Luts I developed it for my style and that we're going to use it all throughout in this tutorial and you also have the free version or whatever conversion Luts that you want to use in your videos so let's get started this is the my conversion Lut and I'm just going to add maybe two points of green that's a little bit too much so I'm gonna go with 26 and a touch because in the Cenote what happened is that there's a lot of greens reflecting through these Mossy rocks and the trees as well so the skin tones is gonna get affected on that and we're gonna isolate that a little bit later okay so first things first we're gonna balance the image meaning that we want to really neutralize the colors and make sure that it's neutral as possible so that we can really push the looks so in this case I don't really have any reference in terms of whites or blacks what we can do is kind of just neutralize the blacks and maybe the whites on here so it's not having any color cast on the neutral tones so we know we're balanced what we're going to do is we're going to neutralize the whites on my hair and the blacks on my hair because this is the only reference point that I have right click and then you're gonna go show picker RGB value and we're just gonna go to qualifier so you can see the value before I'm just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we're just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we're almost all even so I'm just gonna leave it at that again we don't have a card here this is a travel video so we're just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tools that we have in DaVinci okay so now I'm gonna try and see if I'm missing anything on the white values you can see the value before I'm just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we're just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we're almost all even so I'm just gonna leave it at that again we don't have a card here this is a travel video so we're just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tool Vector scope we can see that it's almost at the skin tone line the reason why I'm leaving it first because I want to see how it looks later my skin tone is a little bit reddish and it falls under this line it's not directly on this line because it's going to get us somewhere like uh if we touch this it's gonna give me like really reddish skin tones and that's not my skin tone my skin tone is a little just under it now I want to adjust the exposure for this one so let's go back to waveform so what it does is that it just sucks out a little bit of the color with the little neutral tones and that we're bringing everything back uh that's too much and that we're bringing everything back so what happens here is that the color boost really just decreases the value of the saturation on each level in in numerical form and then saturation we're increasing that by 15 it's more like a multiplier and as you can see here the blacks and the neutral tones are a little bit more neutral and that it's a little bit more even especially for my light a little bit if you can see here the Cenote has really nice God Rays coming in and with this one is a little flat so we're going to shape that in post with a vignette and we're gonna create a new power window and we're just gonna kind of create a god Ray focusing on the subject and then we're gonna hit invert and we're just going to squeeze this down a little bit and you see how exaggerated it is so what we're going to do is a little bit darker kind of like this and then we're gonna soften it the print and then we're gonna do Kodak two three A3 enable that and it's a little bit weird right now that's why we started with the PFE adjust we're gonna try to find the Black Point we're gonna enable this where it looks natural and then the white Point as well where it looks natural you can see that it adds a lot of contrast so we're gonna try and reduce that tonal contrast and then the target white is the white balance that you started with so we had a little warmer tone so we're add a little bit of blue in the shadows um perfect and then some green cast to it awesome and then from the PFE adjust what happens if you do the print film emulation the Kodak 2383 we can increase the saturation because it sucks it out perfect that's good so now without the PFE it looks like this it looks normal but with the PFE is a little more stylized now the problem with this one is the skin tones it's too orange we're gonna go back to the skin node and what we're gonna do is go back to Vector scope you can see that it's a clean white we're gonna add [Music] I'm gonna do the radius maybe grow no we're gonna shrink it and then we're just gonna keep blurring it so that the edges are softer and then the noise for sure what I do is that we're just gonna magic mask everything but now it's gonna follow the subject great okay now now what we can do here is that bringing everything back and that looks perfect now I can see that it's just right below the skin tone line and if we push it to the skin tone line I just become more bit so uh what we can do is that we're gonna copy this and then create a new node and then this is going to be halation and then paste it there we're gonna enable the bloom and then we're gonna enable the halation on this one so that the bloom affects all the entirety of the image and then this is just Asian and what we're going to do is we're going to create a mask to the subject right here and then soft right there invert so everything gets halation but my skin tones and then we're gonna track it as well and we're done this is our look right here okay so next up we're gonna match this to the other Cenote footage we're gonna do is grab a still right here and then we just drag this we're gonna disable the skin and also delete the power grade for the halation this is a little bit too much on the halation so what we're gonna do is we are just gonna bring it down a tad and then I do want the bloom to be a little bit dreamier so we're just going to really push that so the trees is a little bit something I'm just showing you guys how I step by step do this and we are going to go to Hue versus uh U versus saturation and we're gonna get that red color and we're just going to increase the saturation so it bumps up so it pops a little bit more because without it it's looking a little dull and with it now we have some leading lines and contrasting to the blue and the green as well okay so now what we can do is grab this still because we're going to do the same thing with this shot and as you can see shots now we're gonna move on to the nighttime shots in Taiwan and let me show you guys how to quickly grade this and we're just gonna go on to my power grade again via workflow and this is quite easy so let's go to CST what we're going to do is we're going to do add the film let and then add the green tint to it perfect now as you can see that the highlights and the Shadows are a little bit crushed so we're going to go to the adjust we're going to ignore everything else we're going to quickly grade this couldn't retain anything for those lights so since it's low light we do want it to be dark but the Shadows are now crushed we're going to lift it up just a tiny bit so that we get a little bit more footage on there and then and then now we can add a little bit more green and then we're gonna go to the look which we're gonna add some blue tones to it or some green tones to the Shadows teal or green doesn't matter and then the gamma to a little cooler tone to the blue side that's a little too much actually because I love that profile and then we're gonna reset the sharpen to just adjust and then what we're gonna do is enable PFE kodak2383 print film and we're just going to adjust the colors and then from me here on we're just going to adjust the white balance to maybe a cooler tone and now this is kind of a true orange and teal look low light footage and we're just going to adjust the highlights again and the Shadows so that we retain the information with here because before we had the information on there but with did something to the highlights we're gonna adjust it again a little bit lower perfect and then maybe a darker Vibe with everything last but not least the film grain I love film grain and that we're gonna add this Shadows all under 30. and we're done this is the final look and then we're just going to copy everything again to the other footage right here this is actually almost done just gotta lift up the blacks a little bit and this is the final look as you can see the computer can't handle the answer orange and teal or kind of just green Subway look into this video uh it's a little saturated in my taste and her skin tone is actually closer to Yellow and what we're gonna do is gonna go use saturation give it just a negative value on there and then there you go we're looking at a super green cast and then apply the skin adjustment we're looking at normal skin tones again with a little green cast to it so I find it looks good what it is and then we're just gonna do the same here we're gonna change the adjust because you learned something new and

Inspired by Gogol's story of the same name and by his \"Diary of a Madman,\" it tells of the Man, a poor, downtrodden creature with a shabby, threadbare coat. At work, he is bullied and ridiculed by his fellow draftsmen and scorned by the pretty secretaries. At home he is relentlessly pursued by his lusty landlady, cigarette dangling unappetizingly from her mouth, but he is too timid or too sensitive to succumb to her advances.\nThe Overcoat” is a simple moral fable, told in truly remarkable fashion. Inspired by Gogol’s story of the same name and by his “Diary of a Madman,” it tells of the Man, a poor, downtrodden creature with a shabby, threadbare coat. At work, he is bullied and ridiculed by his fellow draftsmen and scorned by the pretty secretaries. At home he is relentlessly pursued by his lusty landlady, cigarette dangling unappetizingly from her mouth, but he is too timid or too sensitive to succumb to her advances.\nAll this changes when he visits the tailor and has a wonderful coat made. Suddenly he’s a king: his bosses and the secretaries think he’s wonderful. Then he has a drink (actually several drinks) too many, finds himself in the red light district, is robbed of his coat and descends into madness, harsh punishment indeed for only a modest display of hubris.\nWhat makes this production exceptional is that the tale is told without a single word being spoken. Panych, an accomplished playwright, and Goring, an award-winning choreographer, have woven a seamless piece of dance theater that operates on a grand scale. Accompanied by the music of Dmitri Shostakovich, the cast of 22 swirls through scenes as public as a sweatshop, a men’s outfitters and a streetcar, as private as the Man’s bedroom and as chilling as an insane asylum.\nThe style is Chaplinesque and lovingly borrowed from the silent-movie era. Movements are broad, often jerky, and the actingstyle is large without slipping into the melodramatic. Set designer Ken MacDonald pays tribute to “Metropolis” and “Modern Times” with a magnificent wall of windows and huge, slowly turning industrial wheels that descend from time to time.\nAt the heart of the show is the long lean figure of Peter Anderson as the Man , a nerd touched with nobility. Like Chaplin, he has a sweet innocence that triumphantly survives all the vicious tricks hurled at him by an uncaring, vindictive world. The final scene is heartrending.\n“The Overcoat” swept eight of Vancouver’s local theater awards in 1997 and is finally crossing Canada. After it closes in Toronto, it moves to Ottawa’s National Arts Center and on to Winnipeg’s Manitoba Theater Center. With a two-story set weighing in at over 10 tons and with 85 costumes, it’s taken a while to arrange the tour. It’s been well worth the wait.\nProduction: TORONTO A Canadian Stage Co. presentation of the Vancouver Playhouse production of a dance drama in two acts conceived and directed by Morris Panych and Wendy Goring.\nCrew: Set, Ken MacDonald; costumes, Nancy Bryant; lighting, Alan Brodie.
