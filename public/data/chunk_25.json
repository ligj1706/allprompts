The latter incident, which occurred around noon in the parking lot of the nearby Freret Market before spilling into the middle of Napoleon Avenue, ended with one of the girls in the hospital and the arrest of a 7th Ward man accused of running into her with his truck.\nView full sizeMichael DeMocker, The Times-PicayuneNew Orleans police investigate outside Sojourner Truth Academy at Freret and Jena streets after a fight between several students led to a parent running over a female student with his truck and leaving the scene on Tuesday.\nThe brawl comes less than two weeks after 12 students were arrested for a pair of fights at Abramson Science and Technology School, and offers a startling example of how an apparent insult hurled over social media among teenagers can sometimes quickly morph into violence.\n\"That's where these major altercations come from,\" said Marika Barto, a former teacher at Sojourner who happened to be sitting in a school office with one of the girls involved when the fight broke out across the street. \"They always start out with social media. Something goes wrong, someone says something about someone else, and it ends up in a physical fight. When it starts to draw in family like this, it gets out of control.\"\nBarto said the two girls involved were in an earlier fight at the school about 10:30 in the morning. Afterward, Barto sat with one of the girls waiting for her parents to pick her up in the school social worker's office. Barto said the girl told her the classmate posted something \"inappropriate\" on Instagram, sparking the initial altercation, but refused to elaborate.\nAs Barto and the student waited, the girl's mother and stepfather arrived across the street.\nAlmost immediately, they ended up in a confrontation with the mother and older brother of the female student she had been fighting with, Barto said, and both girls ended up joining the skirmish. Several times, Barton said, one of the adult women involved picked up a brick and hurled it at the other family.\n\"They were punching, throwing each other on the ground, grabbing each other's hair,\" she said.\nFinally, Barto said, the stepfather climbed into his truck with a small child in tow, began heading the wrong way down Napoleon Avenue and mowed down one of the girls before speeding off. Barto said the girl did not appear to be bleeding and was \"alert and oriented\" before being taken to the hospital.\nNew Orleans Police Department spokesman Frank Robertson offered a somewhat different version of events, saying that the father of one of the girls arrived at the school and started arguing with and 18-year-old male student he suspected of dating his daughter. He threatened the boy, then tried to run him over with his truck, but missed and hit the teen's 15-year-old sister.\nThe school's principal could not be reached for comment.\nRobertson identified the man driving the truck as Paul Amar, 42. He said police arrested Amar at his home in the 7th Ward shortly afterward and booked him with aggravated battery.\nJeb Tate, of the New Orleans EMS, said the girl Amar allegedly hit was in fact 17 years old and was taken to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nBarto said she broke up the fight with the school's guidance counselor and an English teacher.\nAnd despite the arrest, Barto said she fears more violence between those involved. \"What I'm hearing is there are still a lot of phone calls being made between friends and family,\" Barto said. \"I have a feeling this won't be the end of it.\"\nDanny Monteverde contributed to this report.

Hardwood floors can help prevent these things from affecting you, and possibly relieve you from many of your symptoms. They will also look amazing in any room of your home. Here are 4 reasons why our hardwood is the best flooring for allergies.\nDust mites are microscopic bugs that live in household dust and cannot be seen with the naked eye. A mite’s life only lasts a few months, but it’s the droppings they produce in the dust that people are allergic to. Dust mites can live deep within carpet flooring. So, chances are you won’t be able to get them out simply by vacuuming. When you choose hardwood flooring over carpet, there won’t be any place for the mites to hide and thrive. So, don’t be surprised if your allergies seem to randomly disappear!\nAnother reason why hardwood is the best flooring for allergies is that it doesn’t harbor allergens or irritants. The main difference between allergens and irritants is that allergens can cause an allergic reaction and irritants will only cause slight inflammation in the airways or other mild discomforts. Common allergens include dust, pollen, pet dander, and mold, and common irritants include pesticides, tobacco smoke, and paint fumes. All of these things can easily become trapped in carpet flooring.\nThe most effective way to clean carpet flooring to prevent allergies is to steam it and let’s be honest, steam cleaning can be a pain. This is especially true if you have carpet throughout your entire home. You can vacuum your carpet, but there’s just no way to be sure that you got every allergy-causing thing out of it. On the other hand, taking care of hardwood floors is easy, and will look stunning with the proper maintenance.\nDepending on the type of carpet, it’s recommended that you replace it every 5 to 15 years. Other than the type of carpet you have, there are tons of other factors that can lead to it having to be replaced sooner rather than later. Spilling things that will stain the carpet and possibly cause mold if they aren’t cleaned properly is a big one. Pets also contribute to the wear and tear of carpet in a big way when they track dirt and other things from outside through the house. Hardwood floors only need to be refinished about every 5 years, not replaced. Hardwood floors can last for decades with the proper maintenance, which is also probably why they are the preferred flooring option among homebuyers.\nNow that you know a little more about why hardwood is the best flooring option for allergies, be sure to check out all of our hardwood flooring products to find the perfect option for your home!"}, {"id": 3792, "actor": "Entertainment & Politics", "prompt": "Web search results:\n\n[1] \"But Black Mirror s San Junipero opens up these fault lines between us again, like the crinkles in wax paper when you scrunch it up.
