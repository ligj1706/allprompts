I think this can depend on a lot of different factors; for example, somebody starting a job might have different needs and priorities compared to a person who intends to go on and study at university. Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or something similar.\n\nFirst of all, it’s important to consider finances. Certainly, it is possible for some young adults to get work and support themselves relatively quickly. However, in most parts of the world these days it costs a lot to rent a house, attend university, buy a car or purchase things like insurance. By way of example, I can recall trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggle to pay bills and meet all the other costs of living as a young adult. This in turn had adverse effects for things like my study performance.\n\nIn addition to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential. With your family’s support, it is a lot easier to focus on your studies. Of course, for some people in some situations, the family situation may actually be quite distracting or stressful. However I think it would be fair to say that for most people, you are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night’s sleep if you happen to be living in the family home. I can recall a friend from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn’t eat or study well and inevitably his grades suffered. He had to repeat several subjects and finished his degree later than many of his peers.\n\nFinally, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence. I’ll be the first to admit that there are parents out there who struggle to acknowledge that their children have grown up and deserve treatment as adults; it’s instinctive in many of them to continue pay a ‘mothering’ role that can be quite stifling for a young adult. Despite this possibility, even though I spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respected me as an adult as well as their child and they didn’t attempt to interfere too much or limit my independence. I think this is the case for many young people as well, so I don’t think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy the benefits of independence. In fact, I believe the safe environment of the family is a good place to handle the transition to adulthood for all concerned, both the child and the parents.\n\nBy way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for a longer period of time. Families are precious things and an essential part of the fabric of a nurturing society, so I have a strong belief that they can be a powerful guide in helping children negotiate the path to independence."}, {"id": 8341, "actor": "Basketball Strategy & Educational Response Generation", "prompt": "Describe Burial's music, and provide a few artists who sound similarly"}, {"id": 8342, "actor": "Natural Language Inference & Hypothesis Testing", "prompt": "[QUESTION] Premise: \"Three people stand on a basketball court as a ball flies through the air.\"\nHypothesis: \"Four people are running on a soccer field.\"\nDo we know that the hypothesis entailed by the premise?\nIts either three or four people.

He will write for 24 units of five minutes each because 120 / 5 = 24. He can write 600 words because 24 x 25 = 600. He can earn $6 because 600 x .01 = 6..

It takes 5 miles of cable to electrify 1 mile of street. If cable costs $2000/mile, what is the total cost of cable for the neighborhood?\nLet's think: First find the total distance of the east - west streets: 18 streets * 2 miles / street = 36 miles. Then find the total distance of the north - south streets: 10 streets * 4 miles / street = 40 miles. Then add the number of miles from each type of street to find the total distance: 36 miles + 40 miles = 76 miles. Then multiply that number by 5 to find the number of miles of cable needed: 76 miles street * 5 miles cable / mile street = 380 miles of cable. Then multiply that number by the cost of one mile of cable to find the total cost: 380 miles * $2000 / mile = $760,000.. The answer is: 760000.\n\nJudson, Camilo, and Kenny decided to contribute money to paint their house.

How much was the cost of painting the house?\nLet's think: If Judson paid $500, Kenny contributed 20 / 100 * $500 = $100 more than Judson. In total, Kenny contributed $500 + $100 = $600. Kenny and Judson contributed a total of $600 + $500 = $1100. If Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny, then he contributed $600 + $200 = $800. The total amount of money the three contributed for the house painting is $1100 + $800 = $1900..

A few developed schizophrenia.\n4:25\nSome climbed the social ladder\n4:27\nfrom the bottom all the way to the very top,\n4:30\nand some made that journey in the opposite direction.\n4:35\nThe founders of this study\n4:38\nwould never in their wildest dreams\n4:40\nhave imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later,\n4:45\ntelling you that the study still continues.\n4:49\nEvery two years, our patient and dedicated research staff\n4:52\ncalls up our men and asks them if we can send them\n4:56\nyet one more set of questions about their lives.\n5:00\nMany of the inner city Boston men ask us,\n5:03\n\"Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.\"\n5:08\nThe Harvard men never ask that question.\n5:11\n(Laughter)\n5:20\nTo get the clearest picture of these lives,\n5:23\nwe don't just send them questionnaires.\n5:26\nWe interview them in their living rooms.\n5:29\nWe get their medical records from their doctors.\n5:32\nWe draw their blood, we scan their brains,\n5:34\nwe talk to their children.\n5:36\nWe videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns.\n5:41\nAnd when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives\n5:45\nif they would join us as members of the study,\n5:47\nmany of the women said, \"You know, it's about time.\"\n5:50\n(Laughter)\n5:51\nSo what have we learned?\n5:53\nWhat are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages\n5:58\nof information that we've generated\n6:01\non these lives?\n6:03\nWell, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder.\n6:10\nThe clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this:\n6:16\nGood relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.\n6:23\nWe've learned three big lessons about relationships.\n6:26\nThe first is that social connections are really good for us,\n6:30\nand that loneliness kills.\n6:33\nIt turns out that people who are more socially connected\n6:37\nto family, to friends, to community,\n6:40\nare happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer\n6:45\nthan people who are less well connected.\n6:48\nAnd the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.\n6:51\nPeople who are more isolated than they want to be from others\n6:57\nfind that they are less happy,\n7:00\ntheir health declines earlier in midlife,\n7:03\ntheir brain functioning declines sooner\n7:05\nand they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.\n7:10\nAnd the sad fact is that at any given time,\n7:13\nmore than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely.\n7:19\nAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd\n7:21\nand you can be lonely in a marriage,\n7:24\nso the second big lesson that we learned\n7:26\nis that it's not just the number of friends you have,\n7:29\nand it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship,\n7:33\nbut it's the quality of your close relationships that matters.\n7:38\nIt turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.\n7:43\nHigh-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,\n7:47\nturn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.\n7:53\nAnd living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.\n7:57\nOnce we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,\n8:01\nwe wanted to look back at them at midlife\n8:04\nand to see if we could predict\n8:05\nwho was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian\n8:09\nand who wasn't.\n8:11\nAnd when we gathered together everything we knew about them\n8:15\nat age 50,\n8:18\nit wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels\n8:20\nthat predicted how they were going to grow old.\n8:23\nIt was how satisfied they were in their relationships.\n8:27\nThe people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50\n8:31\nwere the healthiest at age 80.\n8:35\nAnd good, close relationships seem to buffer us\n8:38\nfrom some of the slings and arrows of getting old.\n8:42\nOur most happily partnered men and women\n8:46\nreported, in their 80s,\n8:48\nthat on the days when they had more physical pain,\n8:51\ntheir mood stayed just as happy.\n8:54\nBut the people who were in unhappy relationships,\n8:57\non the days when they reported more physical pain,\n9:00\nit was magnified by more emotional pain.\n9:04\nAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health\n9:08\nis that good relationships don't just protect our bodies,\n9:12\nthey protect our brains.\n9:14\nIt turns out that being in a securely attached relationship\n9:19\nto another person in your 80s is protective,\n9:23\nthat the people who are in relationships\n9:25\nwhere they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,\n9:29\nthose people's memories stay sharper longer.\n9:32\nAnd the people in relationships\n9:34\nwhere they feel they really can't count on the other one,\n9:37\nthose are the people who experience earlier memory decline.\n9:42\nAnd those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time.\n9:46\nSome of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other\n9:49\nday in and day out,\n9:51\nbut as long as they felt that they could really count on the other\n9:54\nwhen the going got tough,\n9:56\nthose arguments didn't take a toll on their memories.\n10:01\nSo this message,\n10:04\nthat good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,\n10:10\nthis is wisdom that's as old as the hills.\n10:13\nWhy is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?\n10:17\nWell, we're human.\n10:19\nWhat we'd really like is a quick fix,\n10:21\nsomething we can get\n10:23\nthat'll make our lives good and keep them that way.\n10:27\nRelationships are messy and they're complicated\n10:30\nand the hard work of tending to family and friends,\n10:34\nit's not sexy or glamorous.\n10:37\nIt's also lifelong. It never ends.\n10:40\nThe people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement\n10:45\nwere the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.\n10:51\nJust like the millennials in that recent survey,\n10:54\nmany of our men when they were starting out as young adults\n10:58\nreally believed that fame and wealth and high achievement\n11:02\nwere what they needed to go after to have a good life.\n11:06\nBut over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown\n11:10\nthat the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,\n11:16\nwith family, with friends, with community.\n11:21\nSo what about you?\n11:23\nLet's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60.\n11:27\nWhat might leaning in to relationships even look like?\n11:31\nWell, the possibilities are practically endless.\n11:35\nIt might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time\n11:41\nor livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,\n11:46\nlong walks or date nights,\n11:49\nor reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years,\n11:54\nbecause those all-too-common family feuds\n11:57\ntake a terrible toll\n12:00\non the people who hold the grudges.\n12:04\nI'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.\n12:09\nMore than a century ago,\n12:11\nhe was looking back on his life,\n12:14\nand he wrote this:\n12:16\n\"There isn't time, so brief is life,\n12:20\nfor bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.\n12:26\nThere is only time for loving,\n12:29\nand but an instant, so to speak, for that.\"\n12:34\nThe good life is built with good relationships.\n12:39\nThank you."}, {"id": 8398, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "Compare and contrast the following two equations using the [Cramer's rule] formula:\nx + 2y = 7\n2x + 4y = 14\nExplain the similarities and differences between the two equations in terms of their coefficients and variables.
