If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8 / 13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8 / 13 * 78 = 48 slices. Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48 - 20 = 28. The answer is 28.\nQuestion: Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\nAnswer: Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches. The answer is 12.\nQ: Jose is a collector of fine wines.

Researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the Côte d’Azur Observatory and elsewhere used observations made by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s (SOHO) Global Oscillations at Low Frequency (GOLF) instrument to measure solar oscillations, then used a new technique to determine the speed at which the solar core was spinning. What they did, the researchers explained in a statement, was study surface acoustic waves in the sun’s atmosphere. Some of those waves penetrate to the core and interact with gravity waves that have a “sloshing” motion similar to how water splashes around in a container that is half full. By detecting these sloshing motions, they were able to measure the acoustic waves and figure out how long it took them to travel from the surface to the core and back again. By applying this new method to 16 years worth of GOLF data, the research team determined that the solar core rotated once per week. Their findings have been reported in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Experts have speculated for more than two decades that the sun’s interior may be spinning faster than the surface, but they had never been able to accurately measure its oscillations before, study co-author Roger Ulrich, a professor emeritus of astronomy at UCLA, said in a statement. The SOHO space observatory has been orbiting the sun for more than 20 years, using its GOLF instrument to conduct solar oscillation measurements once every 10 seconds. Thanks to this data, the authors of the new study were able to definitely conclude that earlier speculation was correct, and that the interior portion of the sun does indeed spin more quickly than the outer parts. “We’ve been searching for these elusive g-waves [gravity waves] in our Sun for over 40 years, and although earlier attempts have hinted at detections, none were definitive. Finally, we have discovered how to unambiguously extract their signature,” lead author Eric Fossat from the Cote d’Azur Observatory explained in a statement released by the European Space Agency (ESA).

With colleagues, with partners, with customers… Is that information in safe hands? Or are files available to people who shouldn’t have access? Florbs mitigates the risk of data exposure by giving Google Workspace admins in-depth insights into file sharing habits. How? Let’s deepdive into 2 ways Florbs can help you:\n1) Identifying file sharing habits\n\n2) How to track where files end up\n\nHow to identify file sharing habits within your domain\nWhen collaborating within Google Workspace, there are multiple ways of sharing to other people’s Google Drive available. Depending on your domain settings, you can share files with:\n\nSpecific users\nSpecific groups\nThe whole domain (with a link)\nAnyone with the link (publicly accessible)\nAll four methods are reflected in your Florbs dashboard:\n\nThe blocks show you an overview of the amount of files that are shared by a specific method\nSo, what are we looking at?\n\nTotal shared:\n\nThe amount of files that a user has shared. E.g: the total amount of all sharing methods combined. This block will provide you with an indication whether there is a lot of (external) collaboration happening.\nShared with anyone:\nThe amount of files that are shared publicly. Everyone with the URL to a file is able to access these files.\nDomain shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with the whole domain. Everyone within the same domain as the person who shared it is able to access these files.\nGroup shares:\nThe amount of files shared with a group. When you hover over this block, you are able to differentiate between internal and external groups.\nUser shares:\nThe amount of files that are shared with specific users. The most precise and transparent way of file-sharing. Hovering over the block differentiates between internal and external users as well.\n\nBy using your Florbs dashboard, you can see which sharing methods are used the most. And, whether file sharing is done safely. When combining this with the extensive search functionality, you can also track what kind of files are shared which way.\nThis overview shows you if you need to educate your whole organization about sharing habits, or only a few users.\nShare safely, share specifically\nAlthough all different sharing methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, it is a safe option to stick to the principle of least privilege; If people don’t need full access, don’t grant them full access. File sharing management is as important as other safety measures within your domain.\n\nIt is possible to restrict sharing publicly across your domain entirely. However, there are a lot of situations in which files are meant to be shared publicly. If you restrict file sharing, those files will be duplicated/downloaded or sent as attachments . And they will float around in all kinds of different versions. This means that although you won’t see the sharing within your Google Workspace anymore, it is still happening. Luckily, Florbs enables to monitor your Google Drive without forbidding all kinds of options.\n\nDeeper into sharing habits\nLet’s look at the sharing habits of Scott as shown on the screenshot. He shares a lot of files with groups and users, but a lot of them publicly as well. With the amount of files that Scott shared externally, it could be a good idea to check what is happening. Although sharing files using the ‘anyone with the link’ ’option could have been done intentional, it could be done due to being in a hurry or out of ignorance about better sharing methods as well.\n\nBy using the extensive search function you can take a look at what kind of files are shared. This helps you to make a proper estimation whether you want these files floating around, or if you need to revoke some permissions. Educating colleagues on other ways of sharing or a good conversation about a possible need of groups/shared drives is highly recommended when you identify a lot of shares using this method.\n\nSo, are you wondering how to check these habits thoroughly? Let’s deep dive into the extensive search functionality.\nIt can take a bit of effort, but you can reduce the risk of potential trouble: Educate people on sharing methods, create proper groups and shared drives and arrange clear agreements on- and offboarding when projects or collaborations end.\nHow to track where Google Drive files end up\nThere are two ways to track where data ends up. There is an extensive search functionality where you can search for data that matches specific criteria. However, if you want to analyze the data in less depth, there are some blocks that offer a clear overview as well.\n\nThe blocks with ‘sharing domains’ and ‘shared external’ offer a quick glance into your domain. They show – you guessed it – the domain files are shared with and with which mail addresses the most files are shared. The blocks are quite useful for three purposes:\n\n1) to have an overview of what’s happening within your domain,\n\n2) to identify where possible data exposure could occur and\n\n3) to track remarkable changes.\n\nThese graphs show you important information on the sharing habits of your domain. They identify the domains and users with which the most files are shared. Apparently, there are quite a few shares with personal email addresses (hotmail.com and gmail.com . And what about all those shares with @example.com? Is that collaboration still in place or should these permissions be withdrawn?\n\nDrive audit – the extensive search functionality\nThe extensive search function allows a more in depth insight into possible data exposure. It is useful to do some research on specific files or domains you’ve seen in the overview or to do some routine checks on specific terms or domains.\nThere are multiple filters available, the filters allow to search for files based on:\n\nName, file ID, shared drive location\nWho files are shared with\nThe file owner\nLocation: shared drives, my drives or orphaned\nExposure: anyone with the link , only domain with the link, restricted or not shared\nThe domain the files are shared with\nType of file (drive files like sheets, docs, forms and lot of other files like audio, video, Apps Scripts, Shortcuts and such as well)\nOr combine multiple of these filters at the same time.\n\nIdentified permissions that need to change? By using these filters you can create bulk actions with just a few clicks. This allows you to change permissions for multiple Google Drive files at once. Select the files you want to change permissions for, click on ‘add action’ in the upper right corner and change permissions immediately. (Read more about bulk actions and how to create them at this blog)\n\nAnd voila, you can monitor all file-sharing within your domain. Adopt a more in depth file sharing approach, just keep an eye on the file management of the domain or manage your data exposure extensively.\n\nShare this\nLinkedIn\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nGoogle Workspace management\n\nAbout us\nContact\nCareers\nAdmin Automation\nSecurity & Auditing\nEmail Signature Management\nStart for free\nGet a demo\nPartner\nGeneral Terms and Conditions\nPrivacy policy\nPrivacy Statement (App)"}, {"id": 7431, "actor": "Time & Date Management & Modular Arithmetic", "prompt": "Can you provide a list of proverbs related to the concept of time?
