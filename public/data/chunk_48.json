Each member was part of the\nDMAIC tasks. Formation of such a small team of empowered R&D engineers at the\npoint of the process steps is typical in the LSS methodology and provides the required\ninputs to be gathered to improve the process. A time span[1] was assigned to complete\nthe DMAIC process, with the defined goal of 50 per cent reduction in idle wait time and\na reduction in the process variability through:\n• structured and standardized activities;\n• clearly defined transfer through optimum connections;\n• simple and specific process flow; and\n• small and rapid improvements.\nThe team started with asking the process questions and to gather the voices of\ncustomers, business and the employees in the process (VOC, VOB and VOE) to\nunderstand the critical process steps for the WPs for the process changes. The process\nsteps that did not need critical technical input were targeted for either significant\nreduction or outright elimination to achieve the target of the idle time elimination. In\naddition, the mandate to the team was to understand the “what is” state and the ideal\nstate of “what should be” in terms of the business process.\nThe team started with defining the high-level process flow in the then “present” form\n(Figure 2) to help us define the process boundaries of the configuration control process\nwe want to improve. There are two levels of review forums and team member approvals\nin the configuration control software system. The first thing to observe is that although\nthe activities are standardized, they are not structured. For example, the same team\nmembers who write the change and provide inputs also approve the WP in the computer\nsystem. In a manufacturing R&D environment, this could be large numbers of stakeholders ranging from finance to capacity to different technical areas such as\nmechanical engineering, materials science, physics, chemical engineering, applied\nmechanics, etc. Further, the flow is not simple for anyone wanting to change the process.\nThe information transfer also included so many stakeholders so that the principle of\n“one customer, one supplier, one method of information transfer” was not followed.\nAlso, the format of the WP was different for the two review levels, making it highly\ninconvenient for the authors. Finally, the team members linked the complexity of the\nprocess to the technical rigor – in other words, we did not realize that “Technical difficult\nproblems can be solved using simple business processes”!\nThe SIPOC table (Supplier-Inputs-Process-Outputs-Customers) as shown in Figure 3\nwas used to identify the requirements from the customers (R&D team, factory,\nmanagement and WP authors), the process inputs (software tool, WP template, change\nforums, etc.) together with the process requirements and suppliers. Following the SIPOC\ndiagram, we collected baseline data from R&D engineers via a questionnaire to\ndetermine the time required for each step of the configuration control process, the level\nof their satisfaction with the current process and specific improvement ideas. This\ninformation provided valuable input for the estimation of the current WP process cycle\nand active time and was also used for our future state discussion."}, {"id": 7211, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "I am drafting my gsoc proposal, and i am writing about the tasks of the first part. please formally format the following text, reorder appropriately and explain in detail as much as possible. \n\n Migrating content from the old website to the new website\nPEcAn’s current website at pecanproject.github.io is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Divorce is when two individuals decide to end their marriage. Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.\""}, {"id": 7257, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "can write me a shader unity that will deform grass to move like wind"}, {"id": 7258, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "could you generate an alphabet word cards for 4 years old kid"}, {"id": 7259, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "refactor this to useSelector hook\n\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport Template from './template'\nimport type { MapStateToProps } from 'd2/actions'\nimport type { OwnProps, StateProps } from './types'\n\nconst mapStateToProps: MapStateToProps = ({\n createRelease: { selectedNetworkExtras },\n}) => ({\n items: selectedNetworkExtras.map(({ id, price, shortLabel }) => ({\n id,\n label: shortLabel,\n price,\n })),\n})\n\nconst CartCard: React$ComponentType = connect(mapStateToProps)(Template)\n\nexport default CartCard"}, {"id": 7260, "actor": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "prompt": "what are some ways to get good startup ideas?"}, {"id": 7261, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a letter to my 6 year old son, from Santa, explaining that Santa Claus doesn't exist and well tell stories out of love"}, {"id": 7262, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "What behaviors or characteristics make you trust someone?"}, {"id": 7263, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "In addition to the given prompt, include a requirement that the specific characteristics of the garden must include at least one element that is not typically associated with beauty or gardening, such as a functional or sustainable feature.

The algorithm simulates the effect of each legal move on a game board, and then recursively evaluates the move by calling the `best_move` function with an increased depth. The goal is to find the best move for the current player, considering the potential moves and their subsequent evaluation.\n\nYour task is to implement the missing parts of the `best_move` function and complete the algorithm to make it work correctly.\n\nThe `best_move` function takes two parameters: `depth`, which represents the current depth in the game tree, and `board_cpy`, which is a copy of the game board. The function returns the evaluation value of the best move for the current player.\n\nTo implement the `best_move` function, you need to complete the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the `depth` is equal to a defined constant `MAX_DEPTH`. If it is, return the evaluation value of the current game state using a predefined `eval` function. \n\n2. Get a list of legal moves from the `board_cpy` using a predefined `get_legal_moves` function.\n\n3. Initialize two variables: `opt`, which represents the optimal evaluation value for the current player, and `index`, which represents the index of the best move.\n\n4. Iterate over each legal move using a for loop.\n\n5. Inside the loop, simulate the move by invoking the `move` method of `board_cpy` with the current legal move as an argument.\n\n6. After simulating the move, recursively call the `best_move` function with an increased `depth` and modified `board_cpy` object. Assign the returned value to a temporary variable `temp`.\n\n7. If `depth % 2` is equal to 0 and `temp` is greater than `opt`, update `opt` with `temp` and set `index` to the current loop index.\n\n8. If `depth % 2` is equal to 1 and `temp` is less than `opt`, update `opt` with `temp` and set `index` to the current loop index.\n\n9.

Discuss why the team is making the migration incrementally and why this is relevant to other high-performance engineering teams doing filesystem work debating Rust or Go. Use a witty, but chill voice.\n---\n\nNathan:\n\n- Organizational\n - Our team wants to write Rust. We think it’s neat and it makes us happy. This alone is \\*reason enough\\* to do it as long as it aligns with other goals in our organization.\n - Hiring for Rust-interested web-focused engineers is easier than hiring for Go-interested web-focused engineers.\n - We want to work with the Turbopack people and primitives. Creating our own internal “library” of code gives us the ability to row the boat together. We have similar needs and problems that aren’t addressed \\*anywhere else\\* and it’s important to go together as a team. (Go fast? Go alone. Go far? Go together.)\n- Community\n - There is a \\*strong\\* interest in Rust from the JavaScript community. This makes it more-accessible for people coming from JS-tooling-in-JS land, and enables community contributions.\n - We have had little engagement from the Go community in our projects, and few occasions to interact with them in external code. Not unexpected, but we’d like to build a community and we believe that we can be successful with that in Rust.\n- Ecosystem\n - The Node.js ecosystem is absolutely massive. Almost anything you need has been written in JS, or is forkable. We come from this world, and this is the expectation we have for depth, breadth, and maintenance.\n - The Rust ecosystem has a few extremely-high-quality core pieces that are in \\*everything\\*. `serde` is a work of art. `rayon` is fantastic. Those serve as foundational tools that have \\*solved\\* entire problem spaces in a consistent way for the entire community.\n - Algorithm research happens in Rust, not Go. New toys show up, implement a trait, and poof, they’re in your codebase.\n - The Go ecosystem is not easily discoverable and feels very dead. People regularly write one-off solutions to general problems. Most of the best things are Google-authored and fit with Google’s worldview, but not necessarily everybody else’s.\n - The Go ecosystem has frequently-used yet poorly-maintained libraries that are a core part of the experience (e.g. afero). spf13 “Holowaychuk'd” the Go ecosystem and then disappeared (and recently stepped away from Google and Go entirely).\n - The “correctness” quotient of libraries in Go is somewhere between JS and Rust. Not good enough to be 100% reliable, not as flexible as JS when you need to duckpunch something.\n- C Interop\n - As you get deeper and deeper into Go you start to discover that the best way to do certain tasks is to bind to a C library. zstd, libgit2, regular expressions, and more. This means that, \\*even without Rust adoption\\*, we were going to lose some of the development experience wins of Go.\n - This works “just fine” but the real point here is, once you’ve got a compiler toolchain setup for each of your targets for CGO, there’s little to prevent you from also making the small hop over to Rust. (Once we can compile with CGO, we can \\*also\\* compile to `c-archive` and have Rust call our Go code.)\n- Go Language Design and Priorities\n - Go is designed for network computing run in data centers. It \\*excels\\* at that. The ecosystem of libraries available in that space are of super-high quality. `context` is a work of art.\n - In comparison, Go shipped a read-only filesystem abstraction a couple years ago. It’s still read-only. Why? You don’t write to filesystems in a (Google) data center environment.\n - Our use case doesn’t align with the Go maintainers’ needs and use cases. That leads to needing to roll our own (lots of things) because they’re not a priority to address at language level.\n - No MSVC support.\n- Rust Language Design and Priorities\n - Rust has prioritized correctness over convenience. Paths? Not as easy to use, because the underlying primitive is not easy to use. It returns the complexity to the programmer to explicitly handle correctly. But we care about precisely that in a world where basically 90% of what we do is path handling.\n - In general we believe it is better-suited to ship Rust to a hostile environment like a user’s box than Go. Go’s stdlib “aligns” a lot of behaviors that can’t \\*actually\\* be aligned between platforms—most specifically around filesystem APIs … again a place that we care about.\n - Is able to build on the MSVC toolchain.\n- Vision\n - We want to, with localized heating, boil the JS ocean. (Starting at the places where people are, and slowly moving to boil the whole ocean.) We want to bring full incremental computation all the way from dev time into production. We’re working backward from production with Turbopack, and forward from the build tool with Turborepo. The next iteration of this is “infinitely granular DAG which includes the whole ecosystem.” Nobody else appears to be attempting that granularity.\n - Success here is a \\*massive\\* moat, possibly insurmountable. For context I would have said the same thing about C compilers, but Clang and LLVM have done it over the last 20 years. But 20 years is one hell of a moat and we can respond a lot faster than 20 years to maintain that separation.\n - Being the stewards for the community primitives (in this case `turbo` … which is what happens after repo/pack merger) gives us the ability to push the \\*entire\\* ecosystem forward, slowly increasing what is possible to even attempt.\n- Future\n - We believe that Rust is where the puck is heading. We want to help it get there, and be ready when that future arrives.\n\nNicholas:\n\n- Reasons for Rust\n - Performance\n - Not \\*really\\* valid because performance issues are less language constricted and more inherent architecture issues.\n - But maybe true? Too early to tell.\n - Ecosystem\n - IMO stuff like serde, swc, clap, etc. are good reasons to use Rust.\n - Go has separate interfaces for every text format (toml, json, yaml, etc)\n - Being able to use cargo to share code with the Turbopack people\n - Standardization with turbopack\n - Opens up a future for a whole suite of tooling in Rust\n - Our version of Rome (obviously don’t say that directly) (do we want to talk about future plans?)\n - Eventually use Turbopack’s graph infrastructure (maybe)\n - Go problems\n - Go and Windows.\n- Reasons against Rust\n - Slows down shipping velocity\n - We’ve done a really good job of limiting this. We’ve slowed down our shipping a little but still done a great job incrementally moving and keeping our existing users.\n - Ecosystem limitations\n - Globbing libraries are still a mess. Won’t match JS globbing behavior\n - Hard to determine standard practices\n - You will have less than ideal code.\n - The orphan rule will bite you.\n - Hiring isn’t hard, but the most senior rust developer you can find will have like 5 years of Rust experience, max.\n - Very easy to bike shed with macros, traits, funky types, refactoring, etc.\n - Just because Rust lets you refactor easily doesn’t mean you should.\n\nGreg\n\nConsolidating some points shamelessly stolen from above\n\n- Rust Positives\n - JS ↔ Rust interop is a good story, technically and community-wise\n - Rust ↔ C is a good story, and we use some tools written in C\n - Rust is growing at Vercel and with NextJS, specifically\n- Go Negatives\n - The Go ecosystem is all-or-nothing. Once you need to make use of functionality not written in Go, you lose a lot of the benefits of having been in Go. What we lose:\n - Easy cross-platform static binary generation\n - Compilation speed (still better than rust tho)\n - Writing portable code is hard \\*and\\* not a focus of the ecosystem.\n - Conditional compilation support is basic\n - Platform-related APIs are either least-common-denominator or fudged to look cross-platform\n - Mismatch with community priorities\n - The Go community seems focused on being the best tool for writing an RPC server.\n - `Context` and goroutines are great primitives for request-scoped work within a long-running process.\n - Getting an HTTP server up and running is easy, and GRPC and protobuf is not much harder.\n - Such software is often intended to run on a single platform, or does not interact significantly with the host platform, so a workflow such as developing on `macos` and deploying on `linux` is the straightforward happy path.\n - Interop with other ecosystems is not a priority.\n - `turbo` is a cross-platform CLI tool that interacts heavily with the local filesystem and process tree.\n - Some of the best tools for filesystem interactions are written in C, so interop is important\n - Differences exist between different platforms, we as developers need those differences surfaced to us so we can handle them appropriately.\n - \n\nAnthony’s notes from talking to Greg:\n\n- not necessarily about language features, let’s break some new ground\n- moreso about what we are buliding doesn’t align with the problem we’re trying to solve\n- Go is good for RPCing and webservers and that’s what the ecosystem cares about\n - Go will lie to you about platform specific differences (an ecosystem and community mindset)\n- we want good interop with JS, interop with OS’es, platform specific stuff\n- The JavaScript community is spending time learning Rust right now\n- Globbing and performance stuff is pretty meh, those are language specific features\n-"}, {"id": 7329, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "Write a funny birthday wish for a successful serial tech entrepreneur in Cape Town, South Africa using South African English."}, {"id": 7330, "actor": "Data Analysis & Image Processing", "prompt": "Can you provide an Excel table showing the calculation and result of 12 divided by 3?"}, {"id": 7331, "actor": "Bash Scripting & Database Management", "prompt": "In Linux, How do I rename all the sub-folders and filenames to Camel Case"}, {"id": 7332, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "In what ways do you express empathy to ensure others feel seen and validated in their emotions?"}, {"id": 7333, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "What's a the safest way to teach my young kids how to swim ?"}, {"id": 7334, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "Have you ever overestimated or underestimated someone’s emotional reaction?

Out of the box, there are some great games and apps that can keep you occupied for quite a while (TowerFall anyone?). A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to do more with my Ouya console. I had a growing collection of Humble Bundle Android games that I wanted to play.\nProbably the most annoying aspect of playing with the Ouya is getting files on to the Ouya. One of the latest updates enabled access to external storage. This means you can load files on to a thumb drive (or external hard drive) and then plug that thumb drive into the Ouya to transfer/access. The problem is I’m lazy and I don’t want to walk back and forth every time I need to transfer files.\nIt is actually quite easy to load BitTorrent Sync on to Ouya. The device is running a modified version of Android 4.1. Below I’ll outline two methods for installing BitTorrent Sync. The first method is achieved by simply side-loading the app. Follow my instructions, and you’ll be up and running in 10 minutes. The second method involves rooting the Ouya and installing the Google Play store. This allows you to download the latest version of BitTorrent Sync for Android and keep it up to date.\nStep 1: On your Ouya, navigate to the “discover” section and click on the “app” category. Near the top should be an app called “FilePwn”. Download that. It will come in handy.\nStep 2: Retrieve btsync.apk from the Sync folder (see above), and place it on a thumb drive.\nStep 3: Open FilePwn, and navigate to /usbdrive (or a similar name). You should see btsync.apk. Click on it and install it.\nStep 4: Go back to the main Ouya menu and click on “Make”. Any apps you install that aren’t from the Ouya store will appear here. You should see an icon for BitTorrent Sync.\nMethod 2: Root and install the Google Play Store.\nNote: If you follow these steps exactly, everything should work. You’ll note that I have included a reboot at the end of a lot of the steps. Don’t skip this part.\nStep 1: On your Ouya, navigate to the “discover” section and click on the “app” category. Near the top should be an app called “FilePwn. Downlaod that. It will come in handy.\nStep 2: Load the following apps on to a thumb drive from the Sync folder (see above). Don’t bother with the btsync.apk. You will be installing from the Play Store.\nStep 3: Using FilePwn, navigate to /usbdrive and install OUYARoot.apk. After it is installed, open it. You’ll be presented with a very simple screen that has a single button. You can’t miss it. Click on the giant button to root your device. When this is done, return to FilePwn.\nStep 4: Install XposedInstaller.apk and open the program. After opening the program click on “Framework” and then “Install/Update”. Now Reboot (there’s a reboot button at the bottom of the screen).\nStep 5: Open FilePwn, navigate to your thumb-drive and install ModCollection4Ouya.apk. Now open XposedInstaller again, select “modules” and check the box for the Mod Collection for Ouya. This can be a little tricky. Use the touch panel on the controller to do this. Make sure you actually see the box filled in with a blue check.\nStep 6: For this step, you need to move the ps3ouya.zip from your thumb drive to the internal downloads folder. Open FilePwn, navigate to your thumb drive, select ps3ouya.zip and choose to move it to /storage/sdcard0/download. Open the ModCollection program and enable Google Play Store mod. Then click on “install play store”. This will only work if you have properly placed ps3ouya.zip in the download folder. Reboot.\nStep 6: Launch the Google Play Store and enter your Google credentials. Reboot.\nStep 7: Launch Google Play and search for “BitTorrent Sync”. Install.\n• Make sure you use all caps when inputting a Sync key.\n• At one point, I had an issue with the folders not syncing and I had to enable “use cellular data” in the BitTorrent Sync options. If you are having an issue with syncing, give this a shot.\n• You may want to enable the “disable auto update” option in the ModCollection. Every auto update will disable root.\nAaaaannnnddd done. That’s it. No more running back and forth with a thumb drive. I was able to download my Android apps from humblebundle.com (using BitTorrent!) and add them to my Sync folder. They automatically synced to my Ouya and I was able to install and play.\nI hope you enjoy your Sync-enabled Ouya. If you need me, I’ll be playing Metal Slug 3 for the next few days.
