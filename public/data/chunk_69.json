You WANT - the PROBLEM With MANIFESTING! | Michael A Singer | Top 10 Rules - YouTube\"\nVideo Transcript: \"this whole thing about abundance and attracting to yourself what it is that you want and how to use mantras and spirituality to make sure you have what you want true spirituality is about not wanting is about being filled with joy from inside and then sharing that outside it's not about attracting to yourself what you want people ask me is there a law of attraction yes and you better be scared of it because if it's true that you attract what your mind is thinking you better take a look at what your mind is thinking what about your mind all day when it's complaining and it's yelling at people and it doesn't like stuff but if you're attracting that way so you eventually catch on that it is not about getting what you want it is about learning to find out that what you really want is to stay open and not have conditions on that openness and then it comes down to how do you do that are people capable of doing that or is that just reserved for you know some special beings Buddha and Christ that have walked the face of the Earth everybody is capable of that if I tell you to pick up five thousand pounds you may not be able to do that so I've told you to do something that you have never done and you're not doing it so you may not be able to do it but if you're actually already doing something and I tell you not to do it you're always capable of that because you're the one who's doing it need motivations watch a top ten with believe Nation hey it's Evan Carmichael and I make these videos my first business I struggled to believe in myself I quit on my business partner and the thing that saved me was watching the successful stories of entrepreneurs they gave me the inspiration to keep going as well as the strategies of what to do and quite honestly I still need their stories and motivation today as well so today let's learn from one of the best Michael Singer and my take on his top 10 rules of success enjoy inside you are the one who's closing your heart you close it you are the one who's closing your mind you do that they're your thoughts it's your feelings they're nobody else's so you are in there doing these things so if I tell you the way to stay open is to not close I don't teach how to stay open that's more like finding out how to get what you want I'm interested in you learning to not close but a difference if I say to you I want you to open your heart right now you wouldn't even know how to start but if I say to you somebody says and you don't like don't close you know where to start right because it's happening inside of you and you see the tendency to do it all I'm asking you to do is don't do that I'm telling you that will take you the whole way don't worry about opening worry about not closing there are going to be events that unfold in your life that naturally open you a beautiful sunset a bird singing sometimes you get what your mind wants all right you open great nothing wrong with that don't close how come it only last a minute I'm going to see a beautiful sunset you feel like oh my God I looked into the face of God then you go right back into your mind with all your problems why why don't you learn to not close why don't you get some openness start to work with yourself to not close and this is how to get what you really want the teeth the Deep spiritual teachings are really teaching you how to get what you want because what you want is to feel love and joy and happiness all the time and so if you can get that from within you then can share it rule number two is discover your real self the mind is very strong and one of the things the Mind does is develop methodologies or ways of thinking that let it interact with life and not get hurt and be more comfortable and it's the ego when we develop a self-concept and we change it through our lives but in general there's a self-concept sitting under there saying I was the one that did this and I was the one that went to the school and I'm the one that went there and the one that my father left or stayed or whatever the hell it is excuse me and basically uh all of this unfolds and you end up developing patterns of thinking based upon the experiences you've had all right and what I'm saying at least certainly in my experience is that's not what makes you wake up that's what keeps you from waking up all right the fact that you're identifying with these past experiences and saying that's who I am well it's not who you are you are watching your ego you see it get upset you see it fix things you see it have Concepts and Views and Etc et cetera and even you're obviously very intelligent you can use your intellect to support the ego to support that and and so on right and I'm sure yes you're a very special person very intelligent person and therefore that becomes part of your self-concept okay and then you say a religious person part of your self-concept all of these things are ways you think of yourself and there's nothing at all wrong with that it's wonderful you've been successful you're happy you're doing well all right I'm not happy I'm not doing well I just said that and also like weeping openly at this moment okay but listen to me right that identification with your personal self which is just your mind's thoughts are what keep you from waking up rule number three team is recognize your needs instead of asking why am I not okay why am I not okay you're asking what do I need to be okay that's the major difference of whether you're growing inwardly or you're attached to struggling externally is you think I can only be okay if I get the things that I got before or similar you extrapolate right things that made me had a relationship and eighth grade and it was so beautiful and she was redheaded okay my wife no that's not true all right he was redheaded and she left you know should her parents move right and it was never a bad experience in that relationship it was just the most perfect relationship you've ever had right you understand now if I'm grown up and I I go on a date and shoot a red hat she redheaded I have a pretense propensity toward being open you just asked a question why do we think we need these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man everyone would be proud of me and I feel like I'm helping the ecology and so all of a sudden I'm not okay I'm going to go to Tesla and if I get a Tesla oh my God for a while how am I doing wonderful so that's how you develop your preferences these things all right because we're not okay inside and we've had experiences either you read a book it'll tell you you need that to be okay you watch a movie meet somebody you can have a thought if I had a Tesla okay it used to be a Ferrari that's a Tesla all right I I man and or perhaps a little time without the children and we make our list nobody's judging just be honest you put that down the purpose of this discussion is no matter what you put on that list unless you're very highly evolved my experience is it's not really what you want it's not that it's wrong it's just not really what you want and the way I prove that is as follows let's say you put down I want a relationship I want to meet somebody I want to have that special relationship and then I would ask you what if you would be the most amazing thing but it's Hollow for you you go there and you thought it would turn you on but it doesn't and you just Lowe's going to work and you're just not excited about it so therein lies the what do you really want because what you're going to find is if you were given the opportunity to have a relationship with that person I just described or have the job I just described but it didn't do SWOT for you and it left you hollow inside you would say I don't want it in fact if it's this video absolutely for free there's a link in the description below go click on it and start building the momentum in your life and your business I'll see you there rule number five is overcome anxiety what you want to do is say what's behind the anxiety so when when people talk I don't help people make decisions but we talk about decision making is the first thing that matters is what's your motive now what should you do if how can you figure out what to do if you don't even know your motive right and my you became 23 years old I realized that that voice was running my life and that's what you're saying if it wasn't comfortable I left if it you know whatever it was it was determining what I said it was determined how I acted it was determining everything about my life and yet I didn't know a thing about that voice why was it saying what it was saying why why is it like one person and not another because when you like somebody your voice says I like her so what that come from right and if all of a sudden it said no I don't think so I was in his glory because you know you pull yourself aside it's going to say a lot of stuff made me realize I don't listen to that thing that thing's crazy it just changed his mind all the time it says this it says that like the reason people drink and do drugs is because that thing's driving them crazy do you understand that are you trying to get away from that in inner mess that's going on inside so basically over the course of many years I started an experiment which was what would happen talking about the personal mind I like this I don't like that I believe in this I don't believe in that I want this to happen oh my God I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow because I'll die if it rains that kind of junk just the personal noise that instead of honoring and respecting life is judging it and trying to tell me how to make life be my way instead of my respecting that life took 13. notice amazing thing that energy that was all weird because you didn't touch it it changed it was able to come up all right or you start using affirmation right you sit there and say oh come on this is probably a an older person like my grandmother my grandmother I do yes yes that's right they get to drive and I should not be talking at them or bothering them or even sending them bad vibes maybe they should not be driving any faster well well and the point is it's a latter part of their life and at I trained Mickey this I trained Michael this way all right as I sit there and I look and I say how did it get hot be quiet how did it get hot what do you mean why is it hot well because there's a son out there you mean there's a star 93 billion miles away and you're it's hot it's so hot that you feel it's heat here I'm in Gainesville Florida Miami is about 300 miles away I asked them how big would a fire have to be in Miami for you to steal it in Gainesville if the whole town caught fire you would not even know being grateful and turned on by all of the amazing things that are happening in front of me and all the past experiences I got to have why don't I just enjoy all that and then come into life filled with love filled with joy and give the hold of my being to the moments that are
