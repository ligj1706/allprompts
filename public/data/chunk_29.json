Primarily, our interests lie in the neural collapse (NC) phenomena (Papyan et. al 2020) where the last layer representations (embeddings) and the weights of the classification head align and form an equiangular tight frame (ETF) structure. The NC phenomena was first characterized and analyzed for neural networks optimized with Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss. However, recent work has shown that the ETF structure is the optimal geometry for SCL (Graf et al. 2021). Our hope is to fill in the gaps by approaching the problem from an optimization perspective. With this, we see potential in characterizing the geometry once again as an ETF but in addition we will analyze the data-imbalanced setting akin to what was recently accomplished for CE (Thrampoulidis et al. 2022). This approach has a few advantages: (a) we would be able to apply an established optimization framework in order to further understand SCL; (b) it offers the potential to explore modified geometries due to added constraints, such as those imposed by some modern neural networks. Modern deep learning has been moving towards larger models like Transformers trained via unsupervised means, furthermore, recent works have suggested an increased robustness to distributional imbalances in this setting. This work provides a stepping stone in understanding the implicit geometry of unsupervised settings through understanding self-similarity metrics like SCL which are at the core of unsupervised learning."]}, {"id": 29158, "title": "Literature & Cinema", "content": ["brainstorm 10 ideas for paper topics related to Shakespeare's king lear"]}, {"id": 29159, "title": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "content": ["Code for a web view link to detect OS and redirect to mobile app installed"]}, {"id": 29160, "title": "Literature & Cinema", "content": ["Write an essay in which you reflect on a moment in your life when you had to make a difficult sacrifice for someone you loved.

The testimony offered by the smoker’s other expert regarding cigarette design and the increased risk of one type of cancer was “new” and, thus, irrelevant. The court also refused to exclude the manufacturer’s “empty chair” arguments which attributed fault to non-party cigarette companies (Dover v R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., September 19, 2014, Scheindlin, S.).", "Background. The smoker, Penny Dover, developed coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) allegedly as a result of smoking cigarettes. She filed an action against a number of tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, asserting claims for strict liability, civil conspiracy to fraudulently conceal, fraudulent concealment, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of express and implied warranties. The issues, pursuant to Phase II of the Engle trial plan, were limited to specific causation, apportionment of damages, comparative fault, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. Before the court were preliminary motions in limine and Daubert challenges to the admissibility of certain expert testimony.", "Increased risk of cancer. The tobacco companies sought to exclude the testimony by one of the smoker’s experts, who was expected to testify regarding the effect that changes in cigarette design have had on the risk of developing adenocarcinoma, a type of lung cancer. The smoker countered that the testimony was relevant in determining any allocation of fault because the conduct of all the tobacco companies contributed to her smoking-related injuries. The smoker also claimed that the testimony was needed to rebut the tobacco companies’ contention that she knew of the risks of smoking.", "The court agreed with the tobacco companies. The theory that changes in cigarette design increased risk of adenocarcinoma was new, having been articulated within the last year in the 2014 Surgeon General’s Report on the health consequences of smoking. Thus, the evidence was not relevant to notice or to the tobacco company’s alleged failure to act based on that notice. It was also not relevant to the smoker’s punitive damages claim, which required convincing evidence that the tobacco companies had actual knowledge of the wrongfulness of their conduct, nor was it relevant to the smoker’s strict liability claim because she did not claim that she was suffering from any form of lung cancer. Thus, the evidence was irrelevant in establishing a causal link between the conduct of the tobacco companies and her injuries. Finally, the probative value of this evidence in establishing that the smoker would not have smoked or would have quit smoking despite her nicotine addiction if she had only known about the increased risk of this particular type of lung cancer was far outweighed by the potential for prejudice or confusion of the issues.", "Minimum effective dose. The tobacco companies also challenged the qualifications of the expert who was proffered to testify on the minimum effective dose theory (which states that “there is an effective dose range of nicotine necessary to initiate and sustain addiction”). A review of the expert’s education, professional qualifications, and professional work led the court to conclude that the expert was qualified to offer an opinion on addiction and the minimum effective dose of nicotine. The expert had spent years studying and compiling research to determine why people smoke, and his education and professional work included pharmacology, particularly with respect to the effects of nicotine. The expert had also published extensively on nicotine addiction and had served as senior editor on the 1988 Surgeon General’s Report on Nicotine Addiction. This background and training also qualified the expert to testify regarding the tobacco companies’ marketing strategies and the effects of cigarette advertising on the public.", "“Empty chair” arguments. In rejecting the smoker’s argument that the tobacco companies should be precluded from attempting to place fault with non-party tobacco companies whose liability had not been pleaded or proven, the court explained that the tobacco companies were entitled to use this evidence to rebut the smoker’s proof of causation by proving that she had smoked non-party brands. The tobacco companies also could use the evidence to impeach the smoker’s credibility to the extent that her sworn statements about smoking non-party brands contradicted or refuted the smoker’s claims that the design of the party tobacco companies’ cigarettes stopped her from quitting smoking.", "The case number is 3:09-cv-11531(SAS).", "Attorneys: Charlie Easa Farah, Jr. (Farah & Farah, PA) for Penny Dover.

From here, you can manage antimalware on all PCs within your network, “roaming” laptop endpoints, and remote office endpoints. Although the security suite is cloud-based, each protected system receives a local program called Endpoint Security, which can be downloaded manually to each computer or remotely deployed from within the Control Center.", "The main page of the Control Center features a dashboard that provides a status snapshot of your managed clients. It’s divided into four sections: Malware Activity, Malware Status, Top 10 Detected Malware, and Computer Protection Status. Each section displays a graph or a chart in varying shades of red and green to indicate how your network is faring. For example, the Malware Status section includes a pie chart that illustrates how many systems are infected, fixed, and completely clean. The Top 10 Detected Malware section features a bar graph that can help you identify if certain types of viruses are hitting your servers.", "In addition to the dashboard, Control Center includes six other tabs from which you can install protection and manage settings, set and apply policies, run reports, remotely manage quarantined files, and check user activity logs. Administrators have full privileges, while employees have access only to network security and user management.", "Small Office Security isn’t as Windows 8-ready as other suites we’ve seen. The Control Center utilizes non-touch-friendly dropdown menus, and it’s for desktops and laptops only—no mobile protection is offered through the suite. Because small businesses are especially likely to have employees using a variety of devices, including tablets and smartphones, at the office and on company time, it would have been good to see at least a nod to mobile security.", "For our analysis of Small Office Security’s protection capabilities, we consulted independent data from AV-Test’s December 2013 test results. The security suite received a performance score of 6 (out of 6). This indicates the software is lightweight and easy on system resources, and will run in the background virtually unnoticed. This is especially critical for small businesses, as employee productivity won’t be compromised by sluggish machines, even if you happen to be remotely tinkering around in the Control Center.", "The suite scored very well in AV-Test’s real-world protection tests, successfully blocking 100 percent of zero-day malware attacks (including Web threats). Although Bitdefender wasn’t included in our 2014 Security Showdown, this score puts it on par with other top security suites, including Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 and Symantec Norton Internet Security 2014 . Bitdefender also performed well on the malware zoo detection test, blocking 99 percent of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last four months of 2013. It didn’t flag any safe websites dangerous, and but it did falsely detect legitimate software as malware twice—slightly higher than average—during system scans.", "Bitdefender Small Office Security is designed for companies with up to 250 seats, making it an attractive choice for small business owners looking to ramp up their network security.

It’s critical to ensure people have great ways to create content and express themselves. Today’s genre of public short-form video opens up new ways for people to create and discover content. While Facebook’s discovery engine is designed to support many different formats (text, photos, video, and eventually Metaverse experiences), our biggest gap today is around short-form video and that’s why we’re focused on integrating Reels in Home, Watch, IFR, and Groups.", "Build world-class recommendations technology. While we frequently talk about products people can see and use, the quality of what’s under the hood powering these experiences is more important than ever. Building a world-class recommendations system that is responsive to your interests, can identify trending content and original creators, and makes responsible recommendations while evaluating billions of pieces of content produced across Meta is an incredibly challenging technical problem. It’s a different problem than ranking the top content from the people, groups, or businesses you’re connected to and requires state-of-the-art technical innovation to succeed. We’re investing heavily in our Modern Recommendation Systems initiative with partners across the company to accelerate our work here.", "Unlock messaging-based sharing. Messaging apps have become an important venue for people to share and have conversations with smaller groups of friends and sub-communities. We’re also seeing shifts away from resharing content broadly via Feed and towards resharing content to smaller audiences in messaging apps. Given how much sharing and social interactions take place on messaging apps, it’s important that we integrate messaging experiences more fundamentally into how we enable people to connect and share on Facebook. To that end, we’re partnering with the Messenger team to enable an integrated inbox for more people on Facebook, revamping our sharing flows to enable better sharing to messaging apps across the board, and building community messaging experiences across Facebook and Messenger.", "While the efforts above are called out as priorities, it does not mean that other work across the organization isn’t important. Advancing all pillars of our strategy, ensuring Facebook is safe and enjoyable, supporting our revenue and engagement goals, and contributing to the broader set of Meta-level priorities require a strong portfolio of work across our organization. The reason the priorities above are highlighted is that these efforts represent the near-term, high-lift investments that we must accelerate to unlock foundational changes to how people will use Facebook over the next few years. They also represent some of the biggest - but also most challenging - opportunities for us to succeed with Young Adults. As top product priorities, we’ll communicate regularly about these and ensure that these areas and their dependencies receive the level of focus and investment required to succeed.", "Lastly, I want to emphasize that in January we shared an aspiration to approach building products that are “Trustworthy,” “People-Centric,” and “Unified.” Rather than call these out as a discrete product priority, I want to emphasize that these are values we want to infuse into everything we build as part of the cultural change we’re making throughout the organization.

Upon meeting with several providers, I decided that Stanford would be the best fit for my needs especially since their website advertises that every patient gets a private room. When I had my first two surgeries, just over twenty years ago, I recall the post-op pain, physical therapy, lack of privacy (I had a shared room then) and so fourth being some of the obstables one has to face whlie in excuritating pain. Stanford claims they have wonderful patient care and getting a room was a given. I was wrong.", "I had surgery in late-November and while the procedure went well and I think the surgeon is amazing, the aftercare has left me still feeling anxious. I reached out to Stanford a week ago and haven’t heard back so I feel like it’s best to share my story more publicly.", "My surgery was 8 hours and afterwards, I was placed in PACU (not totally unusual). I was told numerous times that they were trying to get a room for me as they knew I would be there for at least four nights. We asked every person who came behind the curtain that was the space where I was staying—contacted the doctors team—to no avail. I was left in PACU for four nights after having T10-Pelvis spinal fusion. It was one of the worst experiences of my life.", "1. PACU nurses aren’t trained on how to help individuals get out of a bed post-spine surgery. I had to explain how to log roll 9 out of 10 times and nurse came in. It got to the point that I would not call for assistance to use the bathroom because either the individual would put my bed into a “seating position” or they would take too long to come.", "2. PACU is for short-term stays. Staff do not discuss the needs of the patients there (i.e. when they’re switching shifts) so you are constantly asked the same quesitons over-and-over-and-over again i.e. “do you need to wear your brace when you go to the bathroom” (the answer is no, it was for PT to size it).", "3. The sheets were never changed during the four nights I was there", "4. My partner had to ask several times when I would go to the bathroom for someone to change my undermat as it was covered in blood from my incision pumps", "5. The pumps were not emptied regulary and would oventimes be full so I would ooze out onto my dressing gown", "6. They only changed my gown twice even though there was blood on it constantly", "7. Pain mangement was not explained thoroughly to me, I thought I only had two options. One gave me migraines, the other nausea so then I would chase down the symptoms with other medications. It was not until a nurse on the four night told me that there are numerous options that I was finally able to dial in what was best for me.", "While I understand that we live in a different world post-COVID, I do think this could have been handled better and not having an available over the span of 4 nights seems ridiculous. Instead of allowing me to move my location, I was told that they were canceling surgeries and I was lucky because people where in hallways.

The defendant contends that it is not liable for copyright infringement because it makes fair use of the Works in Suit. See 17 U.S.C. § 107. The parties now crossmove for summary judgment. For the following reasons, the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment is granted, and the defendant’s motion for summary judgment is denied.", "The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The plaintiffs -- Hachette Book Group, Inc. (“Hachette”), HarperCollins Publishers LLC (“HarperCollins”), John Wiley & Sons., Inc. (“Wiley”), and Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin”) (together, the “Publishers”) -- are four of the leading book publishers in the United States. Pls.’ 56.1, ECF No. 113, ¶ 1. They obtain from authors the exclusive rights to publish books in print and digital formats, including electronic copies of books, or “ebooks.” Id. ¶¶ 63-68. Publishers and authors generally are paid for sales of each format in which a book is published. Id. ¶ 65. The defendant, Internet Archive (“IA”), is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing “universal access to all knowledge.” Def.’s 56.1, ECF No. 98, ¶¶ 1-2. Brewster Kahle, IA’s Chairman, founded the organization in 1996. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 216. One of IA’s first projects was to document the history of the Internet by archiving every public webpage on the World Wide Web through IA’s “Wayback Machine.” Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 5. IA also works with libraries, museums, universities, and the public to preserve and offer free online access to texts, audio, moving images, software, and other cultural artifacts. Id. ¶ 6.", "This dispute concerns the way libraries lend ebooks. Public and academic libraries in the United States spend billions of dollars each year obtaining print books and ebooks for their patrons to borrow for free. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 113. Libraries usually buy their print books from publishers or wholesalers. Id. ¶ 114. Copies of ebooks, however, are typically not bought but licensed to libraries from publishers through distributors called “aggregators.” Id. ¶ 117. The Publishers task aggregators with ensuring that a library lends its ebooks only to the library’s members. Id. ¶¶ 123, 125. The Publishers also require aggregators to employ approved “digital rights management” (“DRM”) software and other security measures to prevent unauthorized copying or distribution of ebook files. Id. ¶ 126. Demand for library ebooks has increased over the past decade. In 2012, OverDrive, the largest aggregator, processed 70 million digital checkouts of ebooks and audiobooks; by 2020, that number had risen to 430 million. Id. ¶¶ 119, 164.", "The Publishers use several licensing models to profit from the distribution of ebooks to libraries. Id. ¶¶ 120, 122. All four Publishers offer a “one-copy, one-user” model: Libraries pay a single fee for an ebook and patrons check out a copy of that ebook successively, subject to community-based and DRM restrictions. Id. ¶ 127. Each Publisher offers academic libraries a perpetual term under this model, and Wiley grants perpetual one-copy, one-user licenses to academic and public libraries alike. Id. ¶¶ 130-132. Hachette and Penguin limit their one-copy, one-user licenses for public libraries to one- or two-year terms, during which there is no limit on the number of times an ebook can be read and after which a library must purchase a new license. Id. ¶¶ 134, 147. HarperCollins uses a “26-Circ Model,” which allows libraries to circulate an ebook twenty-six times, over any time period, before the license expires. Id. ¶¶ 135-140. HarperCollins and Penguin also use a Pay-Per-Use model -- a onetime circulation to a single patron at a significantly reduced fee -- and Wiley has experimented with various subscription models. Id. ¶¶ 141-146, 155, 191. The Publishers’ library expert testified, and IA does not dispute, that this “thriving ebook licensing market for libraries” has “increased in recent years” and “is predicated on licensing revenues that are paid by libraries to entities like OverDrive.” Id. ¶ 168. For example, library ebook licenses generate around $59 million per year for Penguin. Id. ¶ 170. Between 2015 and 2020, HarperCollins earned $46.91 million from the American library ebook market. Id. ¶ 172.", "IA offers readers a different way to read ebooks online for free. Over the past decade, IA has scanned millions of print books and made the resulting ebooks publicly available on its archive.org and openlibrary.org websites (together, the “Website”). Id. ¶¶ 7, 236; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 12. IA’s basic modus operandi is to acquire print books directly or indirectly, digitally scan them, and distribute the digital copies while retaining the print copies in storage. The Open Library of Richmond (the “Open Library”), another non-profit organization run by Brewster Kahle, buys or accepts donations of print books, primarily from Better World Books (“BWB”), a for-profit used bookstore affiliated with IA and the Open Library. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 313-314, 317, 322, 338. The Open Library then sends the books to IA scanning centers, where operators turn and photograph each page using a book-digitization device called a “Scribe.” Id. ¶¶ 281-283. After scanning, the print books are stored in doublestacked shipping containers and are not circulated. Id. ¶¶ 310- 312; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 23.", "IA’s Website includes millions of public domain ebooks that users can download for free and read without restrictions. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 158, 160. Relevant to this action, however, the Website also includes 3.6 million books protected by valid copyrights, including 33,000 of the Publishers’ titles and all of the Works in Suit. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 14, 240; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 160. The Publishers did not authorize IA to create digital copies of the Works in Suit or to distribute those unauthorized ebook editions on IA’s Website. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 243.", "IA does not make its ebook copies of copyright-protected works available for mass download. Instead, it professes to perform the traditional function of a library by lending only limited numbers of these works at a time through “Controlled Digital Lending,” or “CDL.” Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 11. CDL’s central tenet, according to a September 2018 Statement and White Paper by a group of librarians, is that an entity that owns a physical book can scan that book and “circulate [the] digitized title in place of [the] physical one in a controlled manner.” Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 436. CDL’s most critical component is a one-to-one “owned to loaned ratio.” Id. Thus, a library or organization that practices CDL will seek to “only loan simultaneously the number of copies that it has legitimately acquired.” Id. “For example, if a library owns three copies of a title and digitizes one copy, it may use CDL to circulate one digital copy and two print, or three digital copies, or two digital copies and one print; in all cases, it could only circulate the same number of copies that it owned before digitization.” Id. According to IA, CDL is especially helpful for patrons who live far from a brick-andmortar library, patrons seeking a book not available from their local library, patrons with disabilities that make it difficult to hold or read print books, and patrons who want brief or spontaneous access to books and for whom it would not be worth a trip to a brick-and-mortar library. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 55-56.", "Under IA’s implementation of CDL, two factors determine the number of digital copies of a book that can be borrowed at any time from IA’s Website. Id. ¶ 50. First, IA makes available one digital copy for each non-circulating print book it keeps in storage. Id. ¶ 51. Second, IA partners with libraries to “contribute” the number of their print copies of the book toward the number of lendable copies on IA’s Website. Id. ¶ 52. Even if a partner library has multiple copies of a book, IA counts only one additional copy per library. Id. For example, if IA owns one non-circulating print copy of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie (1932), and three partner libraries each contribute a copy of the book, IA would lend its digital copy of Little House on the Prairie to up to four patrons at a time. Id. ¶ 53.2", "Around 2018, IA began expanding significantly its lending capacity of copyright-protected works through the “Open Libraries” project. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 355. Libraries now can “pool[] their physical collections” with IA “in order to make more lendable copies of digital books available to their users and the world.” Id. ¶ 363. To participate, a Partner Library sends its catalogue to IA to run an “overlap analysis” that compares ISBN numbers for the Partner Library’s physical holdings with IA’s digital holdings. Id. ¶ 365. Whenever a book in the Partner Library’s catalogue matches an ebook on IA’s Website, IA increases by one the number of concurrent checkouts of that book allowed on the Website. Id. ¶ 367. As of late 2021, 62 Partner Libraries, including 13 public libraries, had contributed books through IA’s overlap analysis. Id. ¶ 392. IA encourages Partner Libraries to populate their websites with links to IA’s Website. Id. ¶¶ 393-396.", "Anyone can become a patron of IA, and borrow up to ten ebooks at a time for up to fourteen days each, by submitting a valid email address. Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 25-26. IA never charges patrons fees for any service, including borrowing books. Id. ¶ 25. The Website has titles in popular categories, including Romance, Thrillers, “Books we Love,” and “Trending Books.” Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 514-516. Patrons can read books they have checked out on IA’s BookReader web browser platform, or they can download a “High Quality” encrypted PDF or ePub version of the ebook.3 Id. ¶¶ 207-209, 277; Def.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 32, 34. IA secures its downloadable versions with software that prevents the patron from copying, accessing, or distributing the book after the loan period. Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 34. The BookReader application also has a “Read Aloud” feature that converts the text to audio and plays it aloud. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶ 276. After a book is checked out, a “Purchase at Better World Books” button appears at the top of the browser window. Id. ¶ 346. This button links to BWB’s website, where patrons can buy a used print copy of the book. Id. ¶ 347. BWB pays IA whenever someone buys a book after using the “Purchase at Better World Books” link. Id. IA’s Website also includes a link to “Donate” to IA. Id. ¶ 348.", "In March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic closed libraries nationwide and, by IA’s estimation, took 650 million print books out of circulation. Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 70. Judging itself “uniquely positioned to be able to address this problem quickly and efficiently,” on March 24, 2020, IA launched what it called the National Emergency Library (“NEL”), intending it to “run through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.” Id. ¶¶ 72, 74. During the NEL, IA lifted the technical controls enforcing its one-to-one owned-to-loaned ratio and allowed up to ten thousand patrons at a time to borrow each ebook on the Website. Pl.’s 56.1 ¶¶ 542-543, 547. IA ended the NEL on June 16, 2020, shortly after this action was filed, and returned to its “traditional controlled digital lending,” which remains in effect. Id. ¶ 571; Def.’s 56.1 ¶ 96.", "In the two years after the NEL, IA’s user base increased from 2.6 million to about 6 million. Pls.’ 56.1 ¶¶ 248, 250.

While most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives a great picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam should not be thought of as a disgrace.
