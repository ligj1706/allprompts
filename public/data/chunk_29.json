Whoever accepts the debate agrees to this definition Arguments:1) Recycled plotlineOne of the main 'twists' central to the plot in the movie Ant Man is that the guys who Darren Cross (the villain) plans to sell the yellow jacket suit to turn out to be operatives for Hydra, an evil organization first featured in Captain America 1... While some people may have been blown away from this revelation, others who watched 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' were not blown away, since the exact same twist happened in that movie as well... In The Winter Soldier, operatives of SHIELD were found out to be loyal to Hydra, and the exact same 'twist' was used in Ant Man. Since Ant Man used plot pieces from prior Marvel movies as the main development in their own movie, this makes Ant Man overrated due to lack of a truly original plot. 2) Lack of a terrifying villainDarren Cross was the main bad guy in Ant Man. For those of you who forgot that, I don't blame you.... Darren Cross is the least remarkable villain in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, his only power being that the suit he wears allows him to grow super small and gain super strength, like Ant-Man.... Darren Cross, 'Yellow Jacket', is a far more inferior villain compared to other villains in the Marvel franchise in terms of overall power. Thor villain ============ That soldier who becomes an even bigger Hulk than HulkIron Man 1 villain ======= Obadiah Stone, who makes his own iron man suitCaptain America villain == Red Skull, a legit Nazi leaderThor Villain ============ Loki, a Nordic God who wielded the power of an infinity stoneIron Man 2 villain ======= Ivan Vanko, who makes a similar iron man suit and even hijacks iron man droidsThor 2 villain =========== The Dark Elves, who also had the power of an infinity stoneCaptain America 2 ======= The Winter Soldier + Hydra operativesGuardians villain ======== Ronan, who also had the power of an infinity stone Iron Man 3 villain ======= Aldrich Killian who using extremis becomes a super villain The point is that overall, the main villain in Ant Man is not only far inferior to the villains shown in other marvel movies, but is in fact the most inferior, in terms of terrifying qualities and strength. 3) Lack of a powerful heroThere is a huge gap in the power of villains in Ant Man and the rest of the Marvel universe, and the same can be said of the heroes as well. Ant Man can grow small as his strength grows, but no one in their right mind would believe that Ant Man could take down Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Vision, etc... The huge gap in power of the people in Ant Man to the people in the rest of the Marvel movies are enough to indicate that overall, Ant Man is overrated\nB: The movie 'Ant-Man' is overrated"}, {"id": 4422, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet with JavaScript syntax.
