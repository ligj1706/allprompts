When the mobile phone becomes no longer mobile, then more features also become meaningless. It’s embarrassing to think that it’s difficult to find a small-sized phone these days. It’s especially hard when you’re also trying to find a flagship small phone that doesn’t have shortcomings. I’ve put together the numbers of a few compact phones that look good right now, and blue one is their cons. It’s easy to see that the Xiaomi 13 really has no shortcomings. It’s a bigger phone than the other phones, even a little bigger than the Xiaomi 12. But it perfectly balances size and functionality.

Haha, see Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, do you think I still want to buy it? In addition to the excellent bezel width, other specs are also very powerful. This Samsung E6 panel ensures high brightness while DC dimming is not missing. Adaptive colors, or “True Tone” on the iPhone, are also available. Some people complain that the standard version doesn’t have 2K resolution, but the Xiaomi 13 the display DPI is actually 414, which is sharper than most FHD+ phones.

But the Xiaomi 13 is an exception. Maybe it’s the new 8 Gen 2 that’s so great, or maybe the cooling system is so nice. Anyway, it does well in Genshin Impact, running around Sumeru can’t stress it out anymore. There were lags during the game, all caused by loading textures. To test how long it takes for Xiaomi 13 to overheat, I followed it up with 25 minutes on Spiral Abyss floor 12, and it still held up. Oh, and the frame drops in the middle were caused by loading, not lagging. The temperature after 45 minutes of intense gaming is also only 45°C.", "All in all, it has no problem handling games. But I still don’t recommend it for long term gaming, because the screen is really small. If you have big hands, it will be more difficult to play.", "Compared to the Pro version, the standard version seems to have a less surprising camera system. It does have an average camera performance, but because of this 75mm telephoto lens, it stands out from the crowd of small sized phones. The reason I used to have to use big and heavy flagship phones is that I love telephoto lenses. And most of my photography is taken with telephoto. Now that the Xiaomi 13 also has a 3.2x telephoto and is equipped with OIS, then I can use it with no worries. But don’t get me wrong, I mean an extra telephoto will allow you to compose more angles compared to other compact phones. But the image quality is definitely not as good as flagship phones.", "When the light is bad, as long as you zoom in on the picture, there is very little detail and all are sharpening traces. Just like the S22, it really can’t put a bigger sensor. So let’s give it a pass.", "CAMERA", "Compared to the Xiaomi 12S, the 13’s main camera is a step backwards. Although the sensor is smaller, the performance is not much of a step back. Most of the performance is okay, both day and night. I only have two complaints, one is the purple-fringing issue, which is not very well controlled. Another is that the color is a bit strange. Even though we were using the Leica Vibrant mode, the colors were always very dull. The too-intense colors look even worse in the samples taken on cloudy days. These two problems are even worse on the ultra-wide camera. So I’m actually not satisfied with the ultra-wide camera.", "But then again, if I am given two options, a telephoto plus a good main camera, or a very good main camera plus a macro lens, I would definitely choose the former. Users of smaller phones must know what they need, because most of the time they are not able to have both.", "You should not expect anything from the Xiaomi phone front camera. Except for the Civi series, they all perform pretty much the same. Although the photos look good and rich in detail. But the video performance is really not good. Not only is the 4k resolution missing, but it doesn’t even support 60fps. If you pay more attention to the recording of the front camera, then we recommend you to buy other phones.", "All three lenses support different recording specs. The main camera supports up to 8k 24fps and OIS+EIS. the footage also looks the best, stable and clear. The ultra-wide camera supports up to 4k 30fps, which is also good. But the picture does not look so clear. The telephoto camera supports up to 1080P 60fps. only in 1080P 30fps can switch the lens during recording.", "BATTERY & CHARGING", "67w fast charging and 4500mAh battery, does it sound familiar? Yes, this classic combination is once again found in the Xiaomi 13. I have no complaints about the charging power, 67w is also fast and there is also 50w wireless charging. Plugged in and fully charged in just 41 minutes.", "4500mAh is big for a phone of this size, and in actual use it feels about the same as my 12S Ultra, which lasts 5 to 6 hours. Because of the new processor being more power efficient and the smaller screen, it already lasts about the same amount of time as many 6.8 inch phones. One less factor to stop you from buying a smaller phone, isn’t it?", "After a few days of use, MIUI 14 has no lags or bugs. Their claim of improving the smoothness of the new system seems to be working so far. No matter how fast your operation is, it doesn’t lag. I don’t know if older Xiaomi phones will be smoother with the MIUI 14 upgrade, but at least with my Xiaomi 13, MIUI 14 is definitely smooth enough.", "There are relatively few new features in 14, one of which is the new icon customization feature. Some icons can change shape, but some can’t. The new folders also open the applications inside of it from the outside. Obviously, MIUI 14 also borrows some features from other systems. But it doesn’t matter to consumers, as long as it works, it’s fine. The biggest upgrade of MIUI 14 should still be this: you can delete most of the system applications. Those apps that you never use can finally be uninstalled. Even the album, weather, can be uninstalled. You can keep only 8 apps, it’s very crazy for MIUI.", "When Xiaomi 13 was released, I was very happy because Xiaomi almost created my dream phone. It fits my hand perfectly and didn’t lose important features. Especially the screen, until the S23 was released, I thought the Xiaomi 13 was the best small size flagship in Android.

It is a condition that adversely affects an individual's functional abilities and level of independence by causing chronic impairment and is particularly prevalent in adults and the elderly. Based on Foo (as cited in the Ministry of Health Malaysia, 2010), the prevalence of KOA in Malaysia is estimated to be between 10% to 20% of the elderly population. The growing number of old or natural ageing, and higher body mass index (BMI), are the key factors contributing to KOA, as claimed by Wallace et al. (2017) However, it is common for adults and the elderly to develop knee discomfort or KOA as the cartilage that was supposed to act as a shock absorber for mechanical body weight-bearing movements gradually deteriorates. As a result, KOA can cause chronic progressive pain and disturb the patient’s functional ability. The loss of workforce and other psychological implications can affect a patient's professional life, entertainment, social life, and sleep pattern and significantly reduce the quality of life (QoL) of KOA patients (Askin et al., 2017). This study’s primary concern is to examine the use of manual therapy and exercise therapy in managing the symptoms of KOA, with the primary goal of improving functional ability. Typically, patients with KOA opt for medicine to alleviate pain, oblivious that an active lifestyle is equally required to manage the symptoms of KOA. Pharmaceutical therapies alone will not help patients with KOA improve their functional ability. Therefore, pharmacological therapies should be omitted in this systematic review study. This systematic review study will include all publications and journals describing the effects of manual treatment and exercise therapy on improving the functional ability of KOA patients. This study will then systematically review the medical literature that studied the critical role of manual therapy and exercise therapy as interventions to enhance functional ability and improve QoL. It is necessary to continue this study as the elderly population has a higher risk of developing KOA which cannot be avoided in the natural ageing process that will happen to everyone. Furthermore, Shamsi et al. (2021) studied that age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis will be significantly accelerated in emerging countries and will remain increase in the future, particularly in Asian countries.", "1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT", "The world-increasing trend of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total knee replacement, as claimed by Gao et al. (2020), is worrying. In the future, it is possible as KOA can be popular among adults as early as 30 years old. Most people would want surgical interventions immediately without opting for conservative treatments due to time constraints and non-adherence to exercises. Furthermore, in the early stage of KOA, surgery should not be an option; however, most patients with KOA would still not adhere to the manual therapy and exercise therapy that has been prescribed. Manual therapy and exercise therapy during that stage should greatly help manage KOA symptoms and prevent rapid deterioration, progressing KOA quicker to the severe stage. Even in the later stage, manual therapy and exercise therapy shall be part of the treatment options while seeking surgical interventions.", "1.3 PURPOSE OF STUDY", "This systematic review study aims to disclose the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in improving KOA patients' pain and functional ability. The effectiveness of manual and exercise therapy can be measured using reliable outcome measures of pain and functional ability. A helpful guideline and assistance in advocating for the public to opt for manual therapy and exercise therapy to manage KOA symptoms will be a great success once the efficacy of these treatments has been", "proven.", "1.4 RESEARCH OBJECTIVE(S)", "General Objectives:", "To systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy in reducing pain and improving the functional ability of patients with KOA", "Specific Objectives:", "To systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in managing pain symptoms of KOA patients.", "To systematically review the efficacy of manual therapy and exercise therapy from the published research works in enhancing the functional ability of KOA patients.", "1.5 RESEARCH QUESTION(S)", "Does manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively reduce the pain symptoms of patients with KOA?", "Does manual therapy and exercise therapy effectively improve the functional ability of patients with KOA?", "1.6 RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS", "Manual therapy and exercise therapy will reduce pain symptoms for KOA patients.", "Manual therapy and exercise therapy will improve the functional ability of KOA patients.", "1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY", "Suppose this study aims to prove manual and exercise therapy's efficacy. In that case, it will be able to make a guideline for health professionals and the public, especially for individuals with KOA. Moreover, a solid guideline can advocate for the public and raise awareness of the conservative treatments they may seek to control the KOA symptoms, especially those in the early stage, and could prevent arthroplasty or joint replacement. Naturally, the human with pain perception will avoid moving; however, it is possible to move the body while in pain with the proper technique. Besides that, manual therapy is also there to help individuals with KOA reduce pain through the hands of health professionals. This study is not solely for individuals with KOA but is also great for those who aim to slow down the natural-ageing degeneration process, which leads to KOA.", "1.8 DEFINITION OF TERMS", "1.8.1 Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)", "Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative disorder of articular cartilage.

Divorce is when two individuals decide to end their marriage. Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved.

No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.\""]}, {"id": 30713, "title": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "content": ["can write me a shader unity that will deform grass to move like wind"]}, {"id": 30714, "title": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "content": ["could you generate an alphabet word cards for 4 years old kid"]}, {"id": 30715, "title": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "content": ["refactor this to useSelector hook", "import { connect } from 'react-redux'", "import Template from './template'", "import type { MapStateToProps } from 'd2/actions'", "import type { OwnProps, StateProps } from './types'", "const mapStateToProps: MapStateToProps = ({", "createRelease: { selectedNetworkExtras },", "}) => ({", "items: selectedNetworkExtras.map(({ id, price, shortLabel }) => ({", "id,", "label: shortLabel,", "price,", "})),", "})", "const CartCard: React$ComponentType = connect(mapStateToProps)(Template)", "export default CartCard"]}, {"id": 30716, "title": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "content": ["what are some ways to get good startup ideas?"]}, {"id": 30717, "title": "Literature & Cinema", "content": ["Write a letter to my 6 year old son, from Santa, explaining that Santa Claus doesn't exist and well tell stories out of love"]}, {"id": 30718, "title": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "content": ["What behaviors or characteristics make you trust someone?"]}, {"id": 30719, "title": "Programming & Software Development", "content": ["In addition to the given prompt, include a requirement that the specific characteristics of the garden must include at least one element that is not typically associated with beauty or gardening, such as a functional or sustainable feature.

If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8 / 13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8 / 13 * 78 = 48 slices. Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48 - 20 = 28. The answer is 28.", "Question: Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?", "Answer: Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches. The answer is 12.", "Q: Jose is a collector of fine wines.

Researchers from the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the Côte d’Azur Observatory and elsewhere used observations made by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory’s (SOHO) Global Oscillations at Low Frequency (GOLF) instrument to measure solar oscillations, then used a new technique to determine the speed at which the solar core was spinning. What they did, the researchers explained in a statement, was study surface acoustic waves in the sun’s atmosphere. Some of those waves penetrate to the core and interact with gravity waves that have a “sloshing” motion similar to how water splashes around in a container that is half full. By detecting these sloshing motions, they were able to measure the acoustic waves and figure out how long it took them to travel from the surface to the core and back again. By applying this new method to 16 years worth of GOLF data, the research team determined that the solar core rotated once per week. Their findings have been reported in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Experts have speculated for more than two decades that the sun’s interior may be spinning faster than the surface, but they had never been able to accurately measure its oscillations before, study co-author Roger Ulrich, a professor emeritus of astronomy at UCLA, said in a statement. The SOHO space observatory has been orbiting the sun for more than 20 years, using its GOLF instrument to conduct solar oscillation measurements once every 10 seconds. Thanks to this data, the authors of the new study were able to definitely conclude that earlier speculation was correct, and that the interior portion of the sun does indeed spin more quickly than the outer parts. “We’ve been searching for these elusive g-waves [gravity waves] in our Sun for over 40 years, and although earlier attempts have hinted at detections, none were definitive. Finally, we have discovered how to unambiguously extract their signature,” lead author Eric Fossat from the Cote d’Azur Observatory explained in a statement released by the European Space Agency (ESA). Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What did study co-author Roger Ulrich mean by stating that experts had speculated for more than two decades that the sun's interior spun faster than the surface but had never been able to accurately measure its oscillations before?"]}, {"id": 30865, "title": "Business Marketing & Social Media Strategy", "content": ["Give me 10 ideas for a series of blog posts about web3 and product management"]}, {"id": 30866, "title": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "content": ["4.
