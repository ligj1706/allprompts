The presentation included current litigation issues and advertising tactics. As senior partner and presenter Gil Purcell stated early in his presentation, the goal was to share information and educate members of the ALA about the existing problems with tobacco and challenges tobacco litigation faces in the courts.\nOne of the overriding challenges facing tobacco litigation is defining an \"injury\" and how it relates to a potential case's statute of limitations. Mr. Purcell explained the procedural defense used by the tobacco industry and the current challenge before the courts to decide what qualifies as a tobacco injury.\n\"What is Truth to One is False to Another\"\nTo combat a rising wave of concern over the safety and negative health effects of cigarette use, in 1954 the Tobacco Industry Research Committee issued \"A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers\" calling into question the theory that smoking is linked to lung cancer in humans. The \"Frank Statement\" kicked off the tobacco industries misinformation and no limits advertising tactics. Throughout Mr. Purcell's presentation, examples of tobacco advertising were displayed--examples of the reach that tobacco once had into our lives.\nInternal company documents showed a calculated interest in appealing to and recruiting new smokers before they were of age to smoke. Methods used by the tobacco industry included distributing misinformation, advertising in television shows geared towards young viewers and utilizing social icons to promote the acceptance of smoking.\nThe deceit aimed towards youth was not limited to advertisements--tobacco companies showed no restraint in their desire to recruit new smokers. Mr. Purcell showed a 1963 letter from R.J. Reynolds addressing questions asked by a fourth grade class about the safety of tobacco, which claimed, \"...medical science has been unable to establish that smoking has a direct causal link with any human disease.\"\nA common theme encapsulated Mr. Purcell's presentation, through carefully planned and executed legal maneuvers, the tobacco industry has been able to continue to sell a dangerous product to the public with no responsibility to the people that they knowingly injure. Through the work of Brayton Purcell and the American Lung Association, the public will have advocates fighting to bring them the truth about the tobacco industry and their dangerous products.\nHow is Brayton Purcell LLP and the American Lung Association working to educate the public about the truth behind the tobacco industry and their products?"}, {"id": 7681, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "If Mable was alive at 9am and at 5pm, was she alive at noon?"}, {"id": 7682, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "Can undemocratic processes be enforced by democratic decisions?"}, {"id": 7683, "actor": "Mathematics & Algebra", "prompt": "Devise a real-world scenario where the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be applied to analyze stability."}, {"id": 7684, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "Served to give me information and knowledge about the biometric KYC OCR identity verification system in the app. When the photo is taken, what kind of file can be sent to the system"}, {"id": 7685, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are given a code snippet from a Python module **blvnet_tam.py** that imports a class **bLVNet_TAM** and exports it using the variable **__all__**.\n\nYour task is to implement the missing code for the class **bLVNet_TAM** based on the following specifications:\n\nThe **bLVNet_TAM** class should inherit from a base class called **BaseTAM**.

Pete has been involved in a number of various energy projects over the years and he and I share an interest in antique heavy equipment (this is where I met him). After our meeting, Pete summarized our discussions - see his email below. I'm sharing this with you because in a way, Pete's email forms the skeleton of a business plan for R&R. He captured the main topics we discussed but we need to separate those major topics into their own \"stand alone\" business plans. \n\nFor now considering your present assignment, let's focus on utility work in the USA only. We can look at the other items later on. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, Alan and I developed a budget identifying the \"cost of doing business\" should we move to Texas or California. This summarizes the expenditures we'd expect such as personnel salaries, office rental, vehicles, etc. We did a three year forecast of these costs to see how much money we would need to operate a company down in the USA. This was a rather \"crude\" estimate in that all we did was multiply the rate or cost of an item by the number of units or hours. With respect to the number of hours that a person would contribute, we simply assumed two categories. One is where a person would have full time involvement and therefore would consume 2,080 hours, which is considered to be standard work year (40 hours a week x 52 weeks a year). The other is where they would have part-time involvement and in this case, we assumed they would only work half a year or 1,040 hours. Given more time, we need to refine this estimate a bit more. The main purpose of this budget was to seek financial assistance in the form of a business loan so we were \"conservative\" in our numbers in this estimate. In reality, our actual costs would likely be less but for the purposes of this budget (where we were seeking as much money as we could get), we went slightly overboard with our numbers.\n\nKnowing our costs, we now need to figure out how much revenue we could earn. How we earn revenue is by undertaking projects. So, what I asked Steven to do initially was some desktop research to identify potential projects in the Texas market that we'd be qualified to bid on - specifically, high voltage transmission line work. These could be found by searching various local utility websites. I think there are maybe six major utilities in Texas - like AEP Texas, CenterPoint Energy, Oncor Electric, Texas - New Mexico Power, etc. Projects should be listed on these (or similar) websites along with other information such as schedule (when they are expected to be built), estimated value, etc. After you collect this information, we'll then summarize it on a spreadsheet and assess the value of what we expect our portion of this work would be.\n\nAfter you gather all this information on the spreadsheet, we'll have what we need to complete our business plan and answer the questions Pete asks in his email. And from your research, we'll assume that we earn $X million in revenue per year less $Y million in expenses and the balance should be a positive number that represents our profit.\n\nI hope this makes sense.\n\nFor now, just see what you can do by identifying potential clients (utility companies) in Texas, their project list, the value of these projects and when they're expected to be built. With the information you provide, I'll do a draft of our business plan and share it with you so you can see how your work contributed to our plan.\n\nBest of luck and if you have any questions, please ask.\n\nAll the best!\n\nBill"}, {"id": 7759, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Compare and contrast fiction and non-fiction."}, {"id": 7760, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "You are tasked with generating Y lines of text using a random generator.

Yeah, Shane is out right? Got it. And yeah, we have okay cool fantastic. So Yeah, so I'll just quickly kick off the session. So the purpose of the session today is, as you guys all know, we launched fellow 4.1 Fellow 4.1 comes with a whole bunch of new features. One of those features which is like a pretty big deal. Actually is crocs Cross Workspace, collaboration xwc for short, and it's exciting for a whole bunch of different reasons. One of them just to you guys know, is that it's like, it's a huge way to get more customers because if you think about it,\nJoe Fleming: Right before the guest user fellow and that's great. But the guest users don't have fellow workspaces so they don't pick you. Well, we don't email them. None of this stuff happens. And as you guys have experienced, It's crazy. Some of the things people use fellow for if they're like project managers or contractors or agencies they meet with lots of customers. And they have them always as guests and we never get access to these companies. So now there is an option for those companies to have fellow. And to use fellow with another company that is also using fellow. So, It could be huge for us.\nJoe Fleming: The butt. That the big reason for the session today is to figure out, Because crossword space collaboration has a lot of overlap with guest user.\nJoe Fleming: Training both. When should we pitch one or the other? What are some of the considerations? And we also want to turn this into documentation afterwards, so, That's the other reason for the format. So we there are a couple of things that we'll ask from everybody just to follow a certain format for the session. So you do have a question Just say, Hey, I have a question. Beforehand, which will make it easier for us to pick up that a question was asked inside of the transcript in, the AI will be able to figure it out and we'll build a nice FAQ afterwards from it. And then if you're answering you can say, Hey, you know, Here's an answer. I know it's gonna sound a little stupid and not as natural but try it out, I think it will really help.\nJoe Fleming: And we will also read some of the prompts. He the conversation structured. So that like afterwards we know like this section was about answering this big picture question. Okay. So yeah, Dom\nDominic Jean-Couture: Hey I have a question. I don't know if this is going to be covered but if it if it wasn't going to could we make sure to cover how this might influence\nJoe Fleming: Yes, we absolutely can. Yeah and it we actually have it in one of the sections. Fantastic. Okay, so we covered the intro. I just generated the whole like agenda so I guess I we can talk about this problem just so like kick things off. I am curious to get everyone's take on like your experience with the guest user collaboration feature. So like maybe we can just quickly talk about like, Is everybody like has everybody tried or used The Crossword Space Collaboration feature? Has anybody used it on the sales team?\nAustin Bukovec: not used it, but\nMarcus de Verteuil: Use it for kickoff.\nSarah Collins: Yeah.\nJoe Fleming: Kickoffs. Yeah.\nMarcus de Verteuil: It's thick. Yeah, I love it. Because like, you could just like, Like you can like dish off like all those steps. for like champions, like Hey, I need to fill out this sheet of users for Masterclass. It's pretty cool. You can assign it to the guy and then even link the the sheet and I just like, woke up to a bunch of comments from the champion and it's just like I filled it out. Marcus, make sure you know, can you can you confirm that? They'll be availability next week and like it's nice it happens instantaneously. You can like check them off and and if keep them accountable and Yeah, and they get to experience it as well. So that's the only time I've used it. I think it's really good for that.\n00:05:00\nMarcus de Verteuil: That's the only time.\nJoe Fleming: Cool. That is definitely use case, right? Cool. And then, Let's see, let's go through because I know, we, we will cover some of these items. So, do we talk? We haven't like clearly talked about why crossword space collaboration was created. Sarah mean, do you want to? Do you want to maybe just briefly go over that?\nSarah Collins: Yeah, the answer to why crossword space collaboration was created was because we were looking for a way to do a few different things. One, we wanted a way to increase virality for fellow As Joe already touched upon two. We wanted to simplify the experience for customers especially ones that already have an existing fellow account. So, the product team actually did an analysis and what the analysis showed was that there is about 50 workspaces that had guest users, where those guests had an existing fellow workspace. So this is how we knew that there is demand for a future like this. And then for implementation and for CSM, One thing, we were looking on, at was having the ability to collaborate with our users on the kickoff, on different account plans, all of that, great stuff.\nSarah Collins: So for regular CSM tools, you have the ability to do that. So for example, with Jiminy, we have a tool, I think they use games and we use that to house our account plan for Jiminy and then they can see how they check things off. We collaborate so this can provide that same experience but using fellow which is really cool.\n\""}, {"id": 7769, "actor": "Job Application & Customer Management", "prompt": "Write me a recommendation letter for a student applying to an internship.
