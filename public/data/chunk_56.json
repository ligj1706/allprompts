Although, as Heydon J archly observed in Baker v The Queen , 2 ‘[t] hose polities are very large in area’—indeed, they total nearly 70 per cent of the continent—Australia’s uniform evidence law scheme has clear ‘majority’ status in two respects: \n\n• by jurisdiction, reaching seven out of the nation’s ten court systems \n• by population, now reaching over fi ve out of every eight Australians (ignoring the Commonwealth Act, which applies to federal courts everywhere). \n\n On the other hand, there have been no new Australian entries to the scheme since \nthe Northern Territory’s adoption in 2011. \n\n The non-adopting jurisdictions face a form of limbo, following Australia’s mostly abandoned ‘common law of evidence’, tinkered with by local statutes. But the seven adopting jurisdictions likewise face the prospect of following a revolutionary scheme that has partially stalled. This third edition will continue to cover only the adopting jurisdictions, although it is clear that this task still involves attention to the earlier law (see [ 1.3.2 ] under the heading ‘ Common law ’) and to an increasing set of legislative and judicial divergences in the uniform scheme (see [ 1.2 ], ‘ Uniform law ’.)\n\nThis chapter introduces the uniform evidence law’s basic features. First, it describes the most conservative feature of the scheme: its continuity with earlier traditions of evidence law. Second, it describes and assesses the scheme’s goal of a broadly applicable, uniformly developed and easily found Australian evidence law. Finally, it details the connections between the uniform evidence law and other laws: local statutes, the common law, overseas law and human rights law"}, {"id": 8469, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "What is the difference between passing the error argument in a catch block and not passing the error in js?"}, {"id": 8470, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "Can you create an HTML page that summarizes the impact of the internet on modern business practices?

[2]  The ambassador is the highest official in the embassy and acts as the chief diplomat and spokesperson for the home government. [2]  Usually, if a country recognizes another as being sovereign, an embassy is established to maintain foreign relations and provide assistance to traveling citizens. [2]\n\nBy contrast, a consulate is a smaller version of an embassy and is generally located in the larger tourist cities of a country, but not the capital. [2]  A consulate is essentially a satellite office of the embassy, but its roles are limited in scope, usually pertaining to and prioritizing the interests and concerns of its people and businesses abroad.

The head of an embassy is the ambassador, who is the official representative authorized to speak on behalf of the head of state of the country [4]. \n\nConsulates, while having the same official duties as embassies, usually operate as lesser branches that deal with more administrative issues [4].

(2007). Effect of environment and time of planting on the production and quality of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) storage roots. New Zealand Journal of Crop and Horticultural Science, 35(1), 107-116.\nThe tuberous root yields of yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) were compared from field trials planted in September, October, and November at four sites (Pukekohe, Hamilton, Lincoln, Mosgiel) across New Zealand. The September plantings gave the highest yields at all sites, with the October plantings giving 17% less yield and the November plantings 61% less. The September planting at Hamilton produced the highest yield of 90 t/ha, Pukekohe 64 t/ha, Lincoln 22 t/ha, and Mosgiel 15 t/ha. Regression analysis established a strong positive relationship between dry root yield and accumulated growing degree days (GDD) below 10°C calculated for base temperatures 0, 6, and 8°C (R² = 0.87–0.88). Regression analysis R² values declined above 10°C. Dry root yields were high where heat accumulation was at least 1800 GDD8 for the growing season with c. 1 t/ha of dried roots being produced for every additional 100 GDD8 above 1200 degree days. This relationship helps to identify suitable production environments for yacon. Best root production also needs an undefined level of cool temperatures as at the warmest site crown production was favoured. Total fructo‐oligosaccharide (FOS) content of the yacon roots varied from 48.2% to 67.5%. November yacon had the lowest FOS content and conversely the highest content of non‐FOS carbohydrates."}, {"id": 8525, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "Please tell me how to set up the project with the following items based on create react app\nreact.js\ntypescript\neslint\nprettier\ntailwind\nreact-query\njest\nAnswer in English.\n \n \n \n 지금 번역하기"}, {"id": 8526, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "Have there been any sightings of Sasquatch in the past week?"}, {"id": 8527, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "explain human hearing anatomy"}, {"id": 8528, "actor": "Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning", "prompt": "Explain the architecture and functionality of an artificial neural network using [Python code].
