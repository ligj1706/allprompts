We all know the old cliché that the National Rifle Association has power because its members vote on the guns issue, while gun-control people aren’t zealots. Well, Wayne LaPierre and 46 craven senators, that “majority” of the Senate, have just created millions of zealots, and as furious as I am, I’m also strangely at peace, because I’m more confident than ever that the NRA will never, ever be stronger in Washington than it was yesterday.\nHistorians will see this recent debate, culminating in yesterday’s vote, as the time when the gun-control lobby grew and coalesced. The gun issue, since the 1970s a blunt instrument used mainly to bully rural-state Democrats, is going to start turning into the opposite: pressure on blue- and purple-state Republicans to vote at least for modest measures. And make no mistake, what the Senate voted on yesterday was modest; far too modest, in that we can’t even discuss banning the online sale of limitless amounts of ammunition. The NRA won this one, but as President Obama said in some of the most passionate remarks of his public life yesterday evening, this is just “round one.” More rounds are coming, and the balance of power is going to change.\nYou cannot oppose the will of 90 percent of the public and expect no consequences. You can’t have people saying what Rand Paul said, that monstrous comment of his about Newtown parents being “props,” and think that you haven’t offended and infuriated millions of people. You can’t introduce amendments that encourage more interstate transfer of weapons and give it the way-beyond-Orwellian name “safe communities” act and think that karma will never come back around on you. And you can’t sneer at the parents of dead 6-year-olds and expect that God isn’t watching and taking notes.\nSickening. The whole thing. The four cowardly Democrats, too. Max Baucus, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor, and Heidi Heitkamp. Heitkamp won’t face her voters again for five years. Baucus has been around long enough to be able to be bigger than this. Begich and Pryor, who face reelection next year, have the least lame excuses of all, but they are cowards too. They have to know they did the wrong thing. If Joe Manchin could do what he did—and trust me, I’m from West Virginia, and I know Joe, and our families knew each other, and the whole thing. If Manchin could do what he did, from a state every bit as tough on this issue as theirs, these four pygmies really have to be ashamed of themselves.\nManchin’s courage was remarkable. To say on national television yesterday morning that the NRA lied, just flat-out say it, is amazing. Yes, he has five years too before he faces the voters of West Virginia. We’ll see how that goes in time. I hope, in 2017, we don’t see him suddenly carrying the NRA’s water. But I don’t think so. I think once you leave the church, you leave. He’s like Keanu Reeves at the end of The Devil’s Advocate. He has left Satan’s embrace. Much credit is due Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, too. I don’t know whether a Republican primary is now headed his way in 2016, but as right wing as he is on virtually every issue, he at least stepped forward and tried to be a legislator.\nObama’s words were the most powerful he’s delivered in years. Call it failed if you want, but this was leadership: knowing that he was probably going to lose on the Hill, but putting everything he had into the fight anyway. He took on not only the NRA and its whores in Congress, he took on the blasé complacency of a pundit class that said repeatedly: he’ll never win, so why do this; he should have struck while the iron was hot; he should have talked to Republicans more. Yes, it was clear that a challenge to the NRA was likely to lose, but that isn’t what always should dictate a politician’s actions. He behaved out of conviction. This is rare enough among politicians that Obama certainly should not be nitpicked for this or that little thing he did or didn’t do.\nThis was one of the blackest days in the Senate’s history. It’s right up there with the filibusters of civil-rights bills. And make no mistake, this is a civil-rights issue. The gun nuts—and obviously, not all gun owners are nuts, not even a majority—fulminate endlessly about their rights. Well, that little boy at the Sandy Hook school who got his jaw blown clean off, whose unimaginably brave mother insisted on an open casket so people would have to deal with the reality of what guns can do, had civil rights too, the first one of which is safety in his person. So did his classmates and teachers, and so did the hundreds, thousands of victims, a train of corpses that could stretch around the world, silenced in life, and silenced again yesterday by Mitch McConnell and 45 other people who now have a little bit of those victims’ blood splattered on their hands. They will yet be heard from.\nCORRECTION: I originally forgot to include Mark Pryor as one of the Democrats who voted no. That paragraph has been reworked to include him. Apologies.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Explain why Michael Tomasky believes that the gun issue will start turning into pressure on blue- and purple-state Republicans to vote for modest measures."}, {"id": 8874, "actor": "Software Development & Cloud Computing", "prompt": "Write a program on python programming language that generate OpenAssistant API.

To lose 0.5 kg in a week’s time – strictly through exercise – you’d need to burn up an extra 500 calories a day, above and beyond your current activity level. That’s no small task. You’d need to hike uphill for an hour with a 4 to 5 kg backpack or swim laps for 90 minutes – without stopping. Trying to lose weight only through increased activity – or only by cutting your calories – won’t be nearly as effective as a combination of diet and exercise.\nCutting calories may cause your metabolic rate to drop somewhat. Your metabolic rate represents the number of calories your body burns just to keep basic processes going - and is a big part of your ‘calories out’. But your metabolic rate can dip a little when you cut back on your eating. So even though your ‘calories in’ may be lower, your ‘calories out’ can drop, too – and leave you more or less in calorie balance.\nStrength training can help to increase metabolic rate. When people think ‘exercise’, they usually think aerobic exercise, like cycling, swimming or jogging. But strength training is important, too – in part because it helps to build lean body mass, which can bump up your metabolic rate and help offset the drop in calorie burn that takes place when you cut your calories.\nIt’s easy to make mistakes when counting calories – both in and out. People tend to overestimate the calorie cost of the exercise they do – and underestimate the number of calories they eat. Which helps explain the frustration many people feel when they’re sure they’re doing ‘everything right’ – but the scale just won’t budge.\nExercise is key to good health and anything is better than nothing. When people hear that they might need an hour or more of exercise a day to keep their weight under control, it can be a little daunting. But don’t let the numbers discourage you. Do what you can, do it regularly, and try to go a little further – or work out a little harder – each time."}, {"id": 8918, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "Write a joke"}, {"id": 8919, "actor": "Sentiment Analysis & Programming Fundamentals", "prompt": "Please correct the spelling and grammar of the following sentence, then explain the changes you've made:\nIt was said: \"Have you established the measure through the measure, and you are bound by the fact that the measure is a branch and not a root?

However, during her labour, it became apparent that Peter was quite a big baby and, due to this, they took his mother to theatre to monitor her progress.\nPeter’s head was delivered first, but due to his size, his shoulders became stuck (shoulder dystocia). Multiple attempts were made to deliver his body, including the use of a ventouse (vacuum cup) and forceps. The McRoberts position (a manoeuvre often used in this situation) was not adopted, nor was an episiotomy.\nIt was unclear from the records how long there was between the delivery of Peter’s head and his body, but the degree of trauma our client suffered to his head and neck was disproportionate to the amount of traction required to deliver a baby, even under these very difficult circumstances.\nWhen Peter was born, he was floppy and not breathing on his own, so he needed help from machines. He also had a wound to his head as a result of the attempted delivery.\nPeter recovered fairly well in NICU and was breathing independently. However, a lump on the side of his neck was noted and, after further investigation, it was found that he had suffered a severe brachial plexus injury that affected the nerves found at C5, C6 and C7. \nDuring the first 10 years of his life, our client underwent five separate procedures to try and improve the long-standing impact of his birth injuries, all of which only helped a little. Peter was unable to raise his right arm above shoulder height and had restrictive movement in his right shoulder. He also had significant scarring on his back due to the amount of surgery he required.

This is a great premise to hold onto while writing a short story; stories are a window into a life, not the whole enchilada.\n\nThese five tips for making sure you’re creating enough conflict to keep your reader turning the pages may seem like basics, but I still use them as good reminders about what’s crucial to writing an engaging short story. Often, I’ll write an entire draft and forget about a few of these necessary elements. But always, they show themselves through many revisions, as they are always necessary to make a story really sing.\n\n1. Have your character want something.\nYour character needs to be presented in a way that they desire something, but they do not have it yet. It can be a possession, a person, even a trip to somewhere. In the title story of my book, Alina is stalking her daughter’s boyfriend in a creepy way. In the first paragraph we learn she is outside the boyfriend’s apartment every morning, in the afternoons she’s at the coffee shop when he gets his cup of joe, she’s hoping he’ll be haunted by her presence.\n\nHe is the reason her daughter is in trouble, the story declares. I wrote this line after many revisions, as I knew I had to be upfront about the conflict in the story. In this way, the reader wants to find out what the guy did to her daughter and feels empathy for the mother in the situation.\n\nTo know a character is to know what they want, and the story follows that pursuit.\n\n2. Create a situation that involves danger. \nAny kind of danger, from seeing a suspicious text on a spouse’s phone to being caught in a bank robbery. The tension of that situation is what carries the story forward and becomes its anchor. Unlike novels, every sentence in a short story has to involve developing the plot or revealing more about the character. In revision, I tend to move paragraphs and reshape the way a story unfolds, not unlike rearranging furniture in a room. I cut big chunks that don’t need to be there, like taking out that old sofa you love, but in the end, it has to go. In my story, “How I Became A Banker,” the first line is, When I was twelve I made a promise to myself that I’d make a shitload of money. The reader immediately wants to know why the narrator made such a promise and at such a young age. Again, I didn’t come to this line until after many revisions.\n\n3. Conjure up complications. \nWhatever the situation you create, add some complication to it: Nicola is tempted to flirt with the tattoo artist and does so, and then discovers that the tattoo artist’s assistant is an old school buddy of her boyfriend. She flirts because she is determined to ruin her life, her goal is self-destruction, not messing up her relationship. It’s complicated and sorrowful and the reader is hooked. Be on the lookout for plots that surprise you. It’s usually a good thing.\n\n4. Hide the real problem. \n“It’s not the mud on the floor,” my mother used to say. She meant it as a metaphor for when things go wrong and it seems it’s one thing that’s bothering a person, but it’s usually something else. For example, in my story “You’re Here Now,” Sylvie has never met her father, but she’s on the way to his funeral. The story seems to be about the loss of ever having a relationship with her father, but the reader soon realizes the story is about the resentment she has toward her mother, who never let her see her father or his large family. It’s the hidden thing, the complication behind what is initially presented that can make stories so rich.\n\n5. Make sure the readers know the trouble early, like a few paragraphs in. \nIt’s almost a cliché to say write a story and then delete the first two pages to get to the “heat” or “pulse” of it.\n\nIn Flannery O'Connor's famous story \"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\" the first line gives trouble that seems minor, though it will lead to the catastrophe at the end: The grandmother didn't want to go to Florida.
