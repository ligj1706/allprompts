[{"id": 8700, "actor": "Time & Date Management & Modular Arithmetic", "prompt": "You are working on a text-based adventure game, and you need to implement a quest system. In the game, players can start and complete quests to progress in the storyline. Each quest has a unique ID, and the game provides two methods to interact with quests:\n1. `sm.startQuest(questID)`: This method starts a quest with the given ID.\n2. `sm.completeQuest(questID)`: This method completes a quest with the given ID.\n\nYour task is to write a function, `isQuestCompleted(parentID, questID)`, that determines whether a particular quest, specified by `questID`, has been completed.\n\nThe `parentID` parameter is an integer that represents the ID of the quest that can only be completed when the specified `questID` has been completed. If `parentID` is -1, it means that there is no parent quest and you should ignore this condition.\n\nYou need to implement the `isQuestCompleted` function to return `true` if the specified `questID` has been completed and `false` otherwise, taking into account the following conditions:\n- If the quest with the given `questID` has been started but not completed, the function should return `false`.\n- If the quest with the given `questID` has been completed, the function should return `true`.\n- If the quest with the given `parentID` has not been completed, the function should return `false`.\n\n**Function Signature:**\n`function isQuestCompleted(parentID: number, questID: number): boolean`\n\n**Input**\nThe function takes in two parameters:\n- `parentID` (1 <= parentID <= 1000) - an integer representing the ID of the parent quest.\n- `questID` (1 <= questID <= 1000) - an integer representing the ID of the quest to be checked.\n\n**Output**\nThe function should return a boolean value - `true` if the specified `questID` has been completed, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**Note**\n- You can assume that the `sm.startQuest` and `sm.completeQuest` methods have already been implemented and work as expected.\n- You can also assume that the quest IDs are unique and there are no duplicates.\n\n**Example**\n```\nisQuestCompleted(5, 10) => true\nisQuestCompleted(5, 10) => false\nisQuestCompleted(-1, 5) => false\n```"}, {"id": 8701, "actor": "Programming & Software Development", "prompt": "You are working on a project that involves generating Python override classes for certain C++ classes. These override classes are necessary to provide additional functionality to the existing C++ classes in Python. However, you have encountered a bug in the generation process.\n\nYou have a function called `generate_override_classes` that takes a `declaration` and a `trampoline_name_suffix` as arguments. The `declaration` is an object that represents a C++ class, and the `trampoline_name_suffix` is a string that is appended to the generated class name.\n\nYour task is to fix the bug in the provided code snippet within the `generate_override_classes` function.\n\nThe code snippet starts by appending the `member` object to the `virtual_members` list. If `virtual_members` is empty, the function should return immediately, as there are no virtual members to process.\n\nNext, the code generates a new class name called `python_override_class_name`. This name is composed of the `decl.class_.name.native` (C++ class name) and the `trampoline_name_suffix`. However, you must ensure that the generated class name is unique and does not already exist in the `python_override_class_names` dictionary. If the generated class name already exists, you need to come up with an alternative name.\n\nAfter ensuring the uniqueness of the class name, the code snippet yields a string that represents the start of the Python override class declaration. The declaration should indicate that the Python override class inherits from the C++ class, `decl.class_.name.cpp_name`, and also from another class called `self_life_support`.\n\nThe code snippet then yields another string that uses the `using` keyword to inherit all the members from the C++ class, `decl.class_.name.cpp_name`, into the Python override class.\n\nFinally, the code snippet uses a loop to iterate over each `member` in `virtual_members`. You need to complete the code inside the loop to process each virtual member appropriately.\n\nWrite the correct implementation for the `generate_override_classes` function, fixing the bug in the code snippet."}, {"id": 8702, "actor": "Travel Planning & Destination Guides", "prompt": "You are a senior software developer.

Customers may decide to try a competitor’s product. They may no longer have need of your product. They may have had a bad experience with you.\nBut these lapsed customers have a history with you, and you have some knowledge about them. That means that you may be able to recover their business. It certainly makes them more likely prospects than people who have never done business with you.\nWhen identifying which customers are active and which are lapsed, you need to be careful about the time period you look at. Different businesses have different purchase cycles. A credit-card company might consider a customer to be lapsed if they haven’t done any transactions for six months. But an auto dealer wouldn’t flag a customer as lapsed a year after they signed a two-year lease.\nWhen designing a reactivation campaign, it’s important to try to understand why a customer has lapsed. If it’s a service or quality issue, you may communicate to them about improvements that have been made in that regard. Automobile companies often take this approach after recalls, for example.\nIt’s also important to understand what your lapsed customers were doing before they lapsed. Clues to why they stopped doing business with you may be found in their previous purchase history.\nSome customers, called transactors, do a lot of transactions and pay off their balances every month. Other customers, called revolvers, carry large balances over every month. Still others don’t do much at all.\nThis last group of inactive cardholders can be divided into two subgroups. First you have the truly inactive cardholders — those who have never used their cards at all. The other subgroup is your lapsed cardholders. These customers have used their card in the past but have since stopped.\nNow, suppose you’re asked to design a reactivation campaign targeted at these lapsed cardholders. A critical piece of information for you is which category these cardholders fell into when they were active. In other words, you need to know which ones were transactors and which ones were revolvers.\nTheir previous behavior offers strong clues about why they left. The transactor didn’t leave you to take advantage of a low-interest balance transfer. He didn’t have a balance. But the revolver may well have done just that.\nThis line of thought leads to two different reactivation strategies. You focus on usage with one group and balances with the other. You offer cash back or other rewards to the lapsed transactors, for example. And you offer low-interest balance transfers to the lapsed revolvers.\nThe success of your reactivation campaigns depends heavily on your understanding of why your customers lapsed in the first place. As the preceding example illustrates, previous purchase history can sometimes tell you quite a bit. But understanding why customers lapse is also a popular subject for survey research. You can gain a lot of insight by just asking some of these customers where they went and why."}, {"id": 8763, "actor": "Mindfulness & Workplace Diversity", "prompt": "I want as a general practitioner to do deliberate practice in initial assessment of patients seeking help for depression.

I count myself fortunate to have worked with her on a number of occasions, not least because she is a fantastic professional who models patience, dialogue and enquiry in everything she says and does. If you have not encountered her teaching, I encourage you to move mountains to get to one of her workshops. Now.\nI am still learning from the way she turns diverting anecdote into profound instructions for writing and for life: ‘The best time to write is when you are tired; your conscious mind is less interfering then.’ Or: ‘See if you can finish a draft of a poem in the time it takes to run a bath.’ I see these remarks as more of a life-raft than a touchstone. I have lost count of the times they have kept me afloat in dark times.\nOne day she turned up to a workshop with a slim volume of her poems in her hand. ‘This is for you,’ she said without ceremony, and began teaching. The book was a pamphlet called Vehicle (Slow Dancer, 1999). It grieves me more than I can say that it is out of print. I loved it instantly, sneaking quick readings of poems between exercises. It contains descriptions of things that are fantastically hard to do well: cats, dogs, unemployment, train stations. It has the most beautiful poem about and for one of my other heroes, Michael Laskey. All of it feels natural and utterly controlled.\nFor some reason, though, ‘Instructor’ is the poem from Vehicle that really got to me. It is a microcosm of everything Ann does so well, in poem after poem, here and in all her books: beginning in medias res, no flag waving or signposting from behind the poem, just jump straight in. There is trust in the reader. You see it in her use of proper nouns (Milnsbridge, Cowlersley), the one line of dialogue (‘Wave back. Don’t smile.’) which gives a whole life, the eye for the killer detail (‘reaching past me for his medicine’).\nI wish, I wish, I wish Ann Sansom published more.\ninto his mobile or reaching past me for his medicine.\ntwo constables pause and turn on the pavement to salute us.\nthree ways to recognise an unmarked car.\nMakes me want to read it over and over and over.

This terrane forms part of the Namaqua metamorphic complex that was amalgamated during the 1.1 to 1.2 Ma Namaqua Orogeny. Preserved stratigraphic sequences can be followed on strike (hundred km scale) in domains of relatively low strain. In high strain (more than 12γ) zones, the sequences are discontinuous. Inversion and duplication owing to thrusting and folding are more prevalent in the latter than in the former.\nThe Aggeneys Hills is situated in a regional high strain zone and comprises a late synformal macro-structure, superimposed on five older structural domains. The exposed dimensions of the macro-structure is 20km by 5km and the strike length of the five recumbent folds is 6 to 17km. Zones of high strain that are localised in relatively ductile quartzite-schist sequences separate the recumbent folds. The geometry and stratigraphic relationships of the macro-folds indicate that the stratigraphic packages in the Aggeneys Hills were tectonically emplaced as fold nappes. Collectively these nappes represent a duplex structure.\nThe five fold nappes have been named Soutkloof, Quarry, Klipbok, Dassie and Dabbiepoort. The Quarry fold nappe was chosen as an example to illustrate the details of the structural development of the Aggeneys Hills. Although the deformation is interpreted to have been a progressive ductile shear process, five successive structural events can be locally recognised (D1–5).\nThe Quarry fold nappe is interpreted to be a large kilometre scale sheath fold. The sheath fold provides information about the nature and orientation of the regional strain ellipsoid; the XY-plane trends easterly and is subhorizontal with the X-direction subparallel to the southwesterly trending tectonic transport direction. The mega sheath fold has an allochtonous structure in its northern limb containing correlates of mineralised stratabound units (the Gams member of the Hotson Formation). Structural duplication of ore bearing units may well be present in the unexposed core of the Quarry structure. Similar structural duplication is to be expected in the rest of the high strain zone of the Aggeneys terrane.\nS29°11'60\" - S29°11'60\", E18°46'00\" - E18°55'00\"\nWhat is the significance of the Quarry fold nappe and its orientation in relation to the regional strain ellipsoid?"}, {"id": 8797, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "help me make an calculator from scratch with DevOps and Cloud.

The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.\n\"A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!\"\nI'd been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry's obsession with \"practical steps\" -- and how, whenever the word \"practical\" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it's implied that a list of steps will follow. It's as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that \"stepular\" is not a word but maybe should be.)\nMy friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That's why it's practical. (Aren't words fun?) Practical doesn't mean \"I can follow this without turning on my brain.\"\nFor instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.\nFeeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.\nKnowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.\nYou get it. I'm passionate about this.\nAnd so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:\n\"A list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way!\"\nSmack.\nSwig.\nSmile.\n(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn't entirely unhappy.)\nA list of steps isn't helpful if you're facing the wrong way.\n • If you're on the wrong path, you don't need \"next steps.\" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don't move forward.\n • If you aren't saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.\n • If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don't yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don't know, but I'm pretty sure carpenters don't sit around saying, \"Should I use a hammer?\" I mean ... what are you trying to build?\nIf success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that's not reality.\nAs a result, more often than we realize, we don't need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that \"stepful\" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.\nWe need to face the right way.\nThis brings me to the idea of \"story\" and how it's typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn't actually where we need to go. I'd sum up this issue like this:\nMost advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.\nThese are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you're a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.\nMisconception #1: Stories are special.\nVery commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.\nBut then, yanno ... most of them aren't. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.\n • The monthly all-hands meeting.\n • The company home page.\n • The oft-promoted case study.\n • The new podcast trailer.\n • The big, important essay.\n • The opening moments of a keynote.\nThat's the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.\nStories aren't for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You'll serve others better and so will be better served.\n • When you start to face the path labeled \"Stories are special,\" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path \"Story Everywhere.\"\nMisconception #2: Stories are abstract.\nSomething that is \"abstract\" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.\nThat's how we view this notion of \"story\" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):\n\"So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?\"\nWhat, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?\nTo me, that's like asking, \"What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?\"\nYES! That's just how we communicate. But just as marketers view \"emotions\" as only these extreme things (nope, they're implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view \"story\" as these abstract things. It's all very much OUT THERE.\nEMOTIONS!\nSTORY!\n(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)\nAbstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.\nThe solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let's make this more concrete, shall we?\n • You experienced some stuff. Describe it.\n • You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.\nYou have an idea. You ship the idea. It's concrete now. It exists.\nPrioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.\nThe reason we don't do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It's both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...\nCreative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see \"the code of the Matrix.\" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It's only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It's like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.\nThe internet has put much more of the \"code\" of the creative \"Matrix\" on full \"display.\" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!\nAlso?\nThat level of access is intimidating!\nBecause we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven't produced anything. Other times, it doesn't feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.\nPoppycock.\nThat way of thinking is cock of the poppy.\n(Don't be offended. \"Poppycock\" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning \"soft dung.\" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)\nImagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we'd say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.\nWe would never utter a word.\nBut what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.\nYou've heard stories. So just... start... telling them.\nIf and when you get stuck, no problem. You can find a key to that door rather easily thanks to allllll that easily accessible information. But you don't need it to start or even elevate your work! You can simply start, learn, and keep going. All that advice should serve YOU, but way too often, it feels like we're trying to serve it. Don't try to find clarity to justify creating. Create to find clarity.\nIt's in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It's in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else's ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.\nIf you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.\nThe best way to find a groove is to start grooving.\n • When you start to face the path labeled \"Stories are abstract,\" remember to face a different way. Let's label that path \"Ship Stories Sooner.\""}, {"id": 8800, "actor": "Religious Empathy & Gender in Religious Contexts", "prompt": "explain the difference between hinduism and buddhism in the style of Jerry Seinfeld"}, {"id": 8801, "actor": "Entertainment & Politics", "prompt": "Are there any legal risks involved with torrenting, and if so, how can they be avoided?"}, {"id": 8802, "actor": "Healthcare & Medical Waste Management", "prompt": "Can you summarize the main idea of the text material on the topic of generic drugs vs brand name drugs?: The lone and hydraulic diesel generic drugs vs brand name essay Erick gives you ap psychology unit 5 essay outline and removes your singles or siesta in a binchois de plus en analysis essay simple way.

Answer according to: Again the same process new glugged hook baits and freebies on the spot, by now the heavens had opened and it wasn’t due to stop until 5am. At 10pm and the bar rod was away again a short while later I had another common laying in the net, I was just about to break the net down when the gully rod roared off. Unfortunately after a couple of minutes it came off after checking the hook the point had been pushed over maybe the hook caught the bony part of the fishes mouth or it hit a stone in the silt who knows but a fresh hook link was attached and put back out on the spot. Before I did all this with the fish was weighed and released, it weighed 14lb by this time I was soaked through as I hadn’t had time to put the waterproofs on.\n11pm I heard an alarm but it wasn’t mine it was my dad’s I wandered down to the next swim to see how he was getting on and he had one of the lakes smaller fish it wasn’t weighed but I reckon about 8 or 9 lbs. I just got back into my sleeping bag and the gully rod was off again, this time the waterproofs went on and I was into a better fish after it going under the other line and back over the other way the rods were untangled I had it in the net within minutes. It weighed 16lbs I was made up with the session so far only been fishing for 6hrs and having a few on the bank. I don’t normally do this but due to this rain lashing down I decided to not put the rod back out but the bait was still put out on the spot to keep them grubbing about. 2am the bar rod was away and it didn’t feel that big as it kept shaking its head left and right normally signalling a smaller fish. I was right a 11lb mirror. Same happened to this rod I re-baited but didn’t cast out, I set my alarm for 530am hoping the rain had stopped it hadn’t so I just sat up watching the water for any signs of fish over the spots. 7am arrived and plenty of tea consumed and the rain stopped but I hadn’t seen any fish I put the rods back on the spots, the weather had warmer up a lot it was now 9 degrees at 830am. I kept looking for any signs of fish activity but none, by 9am nothing so the rods came in and I went for a wander around the lake as I knew the fish were in the shallower water by now making the most of the December sun. Due to the flooded swims all the swims that I wanted were taken so I decided to move to another lake.\nI arrived at the mere at 2pm, you have probably read about it in my previous articles, I know this place like the back of my hand and I am after just 1 fish out of here the fully scaled called bullseye. Due the weather still being warm all day and night we set up in the middle of the lake with depths of 5 to 6ft in front of us. My rods were cast out on spots that I have been fishing this year. My rigs were 7inch -combi rigs with a snowman, the only difference here is that I use the Vor-Tex topped with the signature pop ups in pink and white. 20 freebies were put over the top of each rod.\nThe afternoon and night passed without any signs of any fish or bleeps on the alarm, I woke up at midnight and set my alarm for 530am to hopefully hear something. If I didn’t I was going to up sticks and move down to the shallow end. Around 6ish I heard some carp crashing out but as it’s still dark I couldn’t quite see where they were but I knew they weren’t too far away from one of my spots. I decided to fire out a dozen more boilies over both rods due to the amount of bream in this lake. At 10am the right rod that was near the crashing carp was away signalled a slow steady take, after guiding it away from the last remaining pads the mirror was safely in the net. It weighed 15.10 after looking at the scale pattern I realised I caught the same fish 3 weeks earlier from the same swim. After speaking to the bailiff this was the first fish out of here since I last caught this fish. A brew was made and I was scanning the water for signs of fish, I decided to put both rods on the spot where I had caught the fish from to see if they were held up there. After an hour or so after I moved the rod I saw a fish poke its head out over my original spot so the rod was wound in quickly and put on the spot where the fish had shown itself. 15 minutes later the rod was off and the fish was trying to head for the pads. Keeping steady pressure the fish was out of harm’s way and playing about under the rod tip. The mirror weighed 13.8lbs a few snaps were taken and it was released back. Shortly after that fish I decided that it was time to pack up, whilst packing away the rod was away again but this time I had hooked a tufftie."}, {"id": 8810, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "Act as the prompt generator for UI process and I will give you the main keywords by:\n1 Information Product\n-Product Name\n-Brand Name\n-Mail\n-Domain Name\n\n2.
