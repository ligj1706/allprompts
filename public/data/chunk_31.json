Steve Griffin | The Salt Lake Tribune Rep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, talks about HB155 during the third reading of the bill that amends provisions related to driving under the influence during debate in the House of Representatives at the State Capitol in Salt Lake City Thursday February 23, 2017. The bill passed the House 48-26 and advances to the Senate.\nUtah&apos;s new toughest-in-the-nation drunken driving law contains a little-noticed provision that would impose a not-a-drop-of-alcohol-before-driving standard for two years on foreign immigrants who obtain driving licenses here.\n\"Prosecutors think it could become constitutionally problematic\" because it would treat native and foreign drivers of the same age or experience differently, Will Carlson, a prosecutor for Salt Lake County speaking for prosecutors statewide, warned legislators on Wednesday.\nHe added that prosecutors worry \"that may have unintended consequences leading into areas akin to racial or ethnic profiling in traffic enforcement.\"\nIt was listed as one of several unintended consequences of HB155, known best for making Utah the first state to lower the blood alcohol content (BAC) for when a driver is presumed to be drunk from 0.08 to 0.05.\nGov. Gary Herbert signed that bill into law, but called for it to be tweaked before it takes effect on Dec. 30, 2018  possibly in a special session just to focus on it.\nThe Transportation Interim Committee started looking at some of the possible glitches on Wednesday. Its House chairman, Rep. Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said the committee will not consider full repeal of the law, only amendments to it  and the problem with new immigrants was at the top of the list.\nAll Utah drivers under the legal drinking age of 21 currently are banned from driving after drinking even a drop of alcohol. HB155 sought to expand that limitation to all new \"novice drivers\" who obtain a license for the first time  even if they are older than 21  for a two-year period.\nRep. Norm Thurston, R-Provo, sponsor of the bill said, the idea was that since they are developing new driving skills, they are at high risk  and \"if they have any alcohol at all, it&apos;s going to affect them.\"\nThe bill&apos;s definition of \"novice driver\" includes international immigrants who obtain a U.S. license for the first time in Utah  even if they had licenses abroad. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys called Wednesday for it to be stricken from the new law because it does not consider previous experience.\nSen. Karen Mayne, D-West Valley City, also called for removal of the total drinking ban on novice drivers who are older than 21. \"We need to fix that. A novice driver at 19 and a novice driver at 40 are totally different animals,\" she said, adding that older drivers are \"seasoned and mature and know what they are doing.\"\nThe committee focused on safety issues in the bill, discussing them with members of a DUI subcommittee of the Utah Substance Use and Mental Health Advisory Council.\nRichard Mauro, executive director of the Salt Lake Legal Defenders Association, said current field sobriety tests are designed to identify and fail people who have a BAC above .08  and some people between 0.05 and 0.079 might be able to perform well in them.\nHe worries that could lead to more challenges of DUI arrests, and argued it is a reason for possible repeal.\nThe Senate chairman of the committee, Gregg Buxton, R-Roy, questioned if it may be wise to allow lesser penalties for those arrested with BACs between 0.05 and 0.079.\nCarlson said prosecutors oppose that because it would complicate cases that involve both drinking and drug use  where a driver may have a low BAC, but was also impaired by drugs and likely deserves a stiffer penalty.\nSchultz said the committee next month will discuss how to lessen or resolve problems the bill may create for tourism and the hospitality industry, and will also take public testimony about problems.\nThurston said he is working to solve some other issues, too.\nFor example, the bill&apos;s definitions accidentally would make it a Class B misdemeanor for anyone with a 0.05 BAC or greater to carry a weapon  because weapons laws use DUI laws to define drunkenness.\nThat would make criminals out of weapons carriers who are not driving, and who possibly even take a taxi or walk.\nThurston said he also wants to more clearly address what civil liability a bar or restaurant owner  or even the host of a party  may have under dram shop laws for guests who drink, then are involved in a car accident and are found to exceed the new lower 0.05 BAC standard.\nUtah Highway Patrol Capt. Steven Winward told lawmakers the bill already may be cutting down on drinking and driving.\nThe patrol&apos;s DUI squad reports \"running into people now who already think the law is in effect\" and choose not to drink and drive, Winward said, adding it appears that Uber and Lyft ride-hailing services \"are getting more business.\""}, {"id": 4662, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Can you develop a program using natural language processing that generates a 6-word analogy for heartbreak, incorporating a reference to a specific city or landmark?

Although simplified methods of caisson analysis have been proposed, they are either fully elastic analyses that do not account for permanent displacement, or stability analyses that determine whether overturning will occur. In reality, a caisson can incur significant tilt without overturning: such a phenomenon cannot be replicated by either of the above analyses. This paper presents a simplified analysis that takes into account the elastic caisson response as well as the accumulation of permanent tilt with successive wave cycles. Elastic response was simulated using a lumpmass-spring model. Permanent caisson tilt was analysed based on the assumption of the caisson tilting over a circular slip surface beneath its base. A search algorithm was used to determine the radius and depth to the centre of rotation of the critical slip circle. Permanent tilt is generated by the difference between the overturning and stabilising moments during wave peaks. This allows permanent tilt to be accumulated over successive wave peaks. Comparison with centrifuge test data shows that the analysis is able to capture the progressive build-up of tilt reasonably well. Furthermore, comparison with a field case of caisson failure during a storm shows good correlation, although uncertainty over the number of wave cycles precludes a more direct comparison.\nCan you summarize the approach presented in the paper for analyzing the tilt of caisson breakwaters under wave loading?"}, {"id": 4668, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "From where can I get my fingerprint impressions taken in India for PCC from Singapore?"}, {"id": 4669, "actor": "Fitness App Reviews & Robot-Assisted Training", "prompt": "Please explain the phrase \"run slow to race fast\" in the context of long distance running and endurance training.

These adorable dogs may have come to a rescue centre because they've had a rough start to life or their previous owners may no longer have been able to care for them. One thing's for sure though, rescue dogs just need someone who can offer them plenty of love and understanding. If you think you could offer a rescue dog or puppy a warm and happy home, keep reading and we'll answer all your questions, including how to adopt a dog and where to find a rescue centre. Adopting a dog Giving a rescue dog a happy new home can be a rewarding experience for you and a transformation for dog that's waiting for a second chance, but there's a lot to consider and prepare for when adopting a rescue dog. \n\nShould I adopt a dog or a puppy? \n\nAdopting a dog or puppy from a rescue centre can be an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only will you be supporting the work of a worthwhile charity, but you'll also be giving an unwanted pup a second chance. If you're thinking about adopting a dog, you'll need to decide whether you have time for a bouncy puppy or want to get a calmer, older dog instead. Puppies will demand a lot of devotion such as training, cleaning up, disciplining and will require plenty of attention to give them everything they need. Because of this, it's not a good idea to consider a puppy if you work long hours or if there won't be someone around during the day to care for them. On the other hand, if you adopt an older dog, they will already have an established routine, a degree of training and will generally just be more responsible. \n\nFinding a friend for life \n\nIf you're unsure what kind of dog best suits your lifestyle, home and family, your local dog adoption centre can help with that. When you express an interest in rescuing a dog or puppy, the dog rescue will usually give you a questionnaire to fill out to better understand your current circumstances, then they'll be able to recommend a suitable dog for you. They're well versed in finding good matches for both people and pets, so you can rest assured that they can help in finding you a friend for life. Additionally, leading charities can offer you lifelong support, so if you ever have issues with your dog, most rescue centres will be willing to help. If your circumstances ever change, most will welcome their dogs back again too. \n\nThings to consider when adopting a dog: \n\nMaking the decision to get a new dog is always exciting, but there are many considerations you should also take into account. In some sad circumstances, dogs end up in rehoming centres because of neglect or maltreatment. Some may come with a bit of baggage, but staff will always be honest about a dog's needs: be sure you can handle the commitment if you're adopting a dog with a hard history. If you live in rented accommodation, be sure to check with your landlord that you can have a dog at the property beforehand. If you already have dogs, introducing a rescue animal should be done with care. If a dog has been used for breeding or showing, they may have learned certain behaviours that you'll have to help them adapt. It can take time and effort to settle a rescue dog into your home and build a bond, so be patient. Dogs need plenty of space inside and out. Ensure you have enough room in your living arrangements before rescuing a dog. You'll also need enough space in your schedule. Dogs require daily walks and interaction: be sure you have enough time to dedicate to their behavioural, social, and physical needs. There are cost implications of adopting a dog; as well as adoption fees, which vary among rehoming centres, you also need to think about the long-term cost implications of having a puppy. Account for pet insurance, potential vet bills and routine treatments, food, grooming, accessories, toys and kennel bills for when you're on holiday. \n\nDog Breeds: \n\nAt adoption centres, there's a huge variety of dog breeds available, from West Highland Terriers to Husky's, you never know what you're going to get! There does tend to be a lot of more mixed breeds. However, just because a pup doesn't have a pure bloodline, doesn't make them any less of a worthy companion! \n\nHow to adopt a dog \n\nWhen considering how to adopt a dog, the first thing you need to do is to find a dog adoption centre, there are hundreds of options which can be found online or locally. It's a good idea to find one that's relatively local to you as some centres will require you to go for multiple visits to ensure that you're a good match with your chosen pup. Once you've found your perfect puppy, you'll need to complete an application form which will include information about you, your family and your living circumstances, this will help for them to assess if the dog will match you. After this, you can expect a phone call or email from the adoption centre where they'll set up an appointment for you to finally meet your potential pup. Once you get there, you'll be able to meet and interact with them and usually, you'll also be able to visit and interact with a variety of other dogs to ensure that your choice is the right one. One thing to be aware of is that some centres like to make a home visit before you officially rescue a dog to ensure it is a suitable environment. If you already have pets, they may also want to see if the dog gets on with them. Find out more about rehoming centres in your area via Dog's Trust, The Blue Cross, The RSPCA in England and Scotland, Battersea Dogs' and Cats' Home, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. \n\nThe first encounter \n\nWe're all guilty of letting our heart lead our head, you may see a cute little ball of fluff at your local rescue centre and fall instantly in love, but when you get home you might discover that your personalities are not compatible. Due to this, when you first meet your potential pup, you should go with a list of questions to ask the staff. The following questions are a good starting point: Was the dog appropriately socialised as a puppy? How old are they? Do they have any special needs I need to be aware of? How long have they been at the rescue centre? Do you have any information on their life before the centre? What extent of training have they had? These questions are just a starting point, but prior to your visit you should sit down and compile a list of all the things you need to know. Also, think of any desirable/undesirable qualities for a dog, as this will ensure that the match between your and your adopted dog is right first time will reduce the risk of them having to be returned. \n\nDoes it cost money to adopt a dog? \n\nMost dog adoption centres require an adoption fee, which varies between centres. Usually it will help towards the cost of your dog's stay at the rescue centre and the small fee will ensure that they can continue to help other animals. The initial adoption fee will also usually cover your dog's vaccinations, their spay or neutering procedure - if they're old enough - as well as a full vet check-up. \n\nHow do I rescue a stray dog? \n\nBefore rescuing a stray dog, you should firstly ensure that it is homeless. Ask people in the area if they recognise the dog and post online to see if it's lost. You should also visit a vet to see if the dog has a microchip. Once you've determined the dog is definitely homeless, take it to a vet for a full check-up and a microchip for before settling them into your home. \n\nHow long does the process of rescuing a dog take? \n\nThe process varies between cases. If you're adopting a scared or nervous dog with a difficult past, you'll need to visit the centre several times to allow them to get used to you. It'll also depend on if the centre requires a home check to take place too, as this will lengthen the process. That's our guide on how to adopt a dog!

(It's also not necessary....but we'll save that for the end.)\n\nLet's break down why using a real life example.\n\nLet's say you want to buy $500k property in order to turn it into a rental and generate income.\n\nYou will put 20% down and finance the remaining $400,000. So, we'll be taking $100k out of your liquid/investable net worth and moving it into a more illiquid/unavailable vehicle. (We'll come back to this.)\n\n(Of course, there's probably closing costs, advertising costs, some maintenance & fix up work that’s required, furniture refurbishments etc. before you can actually put it out there to rent but let’s assume, to keep it simple, that this is the entire up front cost.)\n\nNow you need to find renters. Let's say you get lucky again and find renters immediately so you have very little time of paying the mortgage without receiving rent back...great!\n\nA 30 year $400,000 mortgage at current 7% rates would run you approximately $2,660 per month. So, naturally, you will need to charge more than that to squeeze out that additional cash flow. But wait. You have to account for property taxes, factor in future vacancy rates, and the maintenance work/fixing costs that will come up over time. All of that, conservatively, means you need to charge about 30% more than the rent in order to break even & “run” the rental.\n\nSo now, just to break even each month, you no longer need to charge $2,660, you actually need to charge $3,459 before you can start feeling like you truly have “extra” income that your family can benefit from. (Yes, generating adequate rental income becomes an even harder proposition in times of high mortgage rates!)\n\nNow let's talk about the \"passive\" part. Are you committed to doing all the work yourself? Are you running the property, advertising to find tenants, showing the property, vetting the applicants, responding to maintenance requests, coordinating the repairs, cleaning & staging before each new guest, answering prospective renter emails, collecting and following up on payments, and dealing with legal if there are issues etc? \n\nYou could do it all…but make no mistake, it is no longer “passive.” It is a business. Is this what you want to be doing? Is this the best use of your time/energy to maximize your life AND your wealth? Or are you hiring a management company? Because now that's a third party cutting into the margins & the standard property management fees run 10% of your monthly rent…\n\nSo, after all of that, and even assuming EVERYTHING goes right, how much extra “income” are you really generating here each month that’s above your costs? $200? $300? $500? We locked up $100k of real capital, which is now unavailable to be used for your family’s OTHER short term financial goals & committed your name to a property for MAYBE that amount of cash flow?!\n\n(Necessary caveat: Of course, it is possible to be profitable in real estate rentals and have this all work out beautifully…I’m absolutely not saying it can’t work. But, my own experience with clients tells me that those that do have successful real estate rental properties have a few things in common. 1. They treat it as both a business & and as a job. 2. They have a sizable cash & investment net worth (at least a $1mm+) BEFORE they look to get involved in any capital-intensive real estate projects!) 3. They inherited the properties and it's already operating like a well-oiled machine as a result.)\n\nOk, so you might say, “Well, fine, maybe I'm not generating much free cash now...but so what! I’m basically building up equity in a home and I’m not paying anything out of pocket to do so…my renters are doing that for me….that’s a win. I just get to own the house!”\n\nSo, this takes us to the second reason that passive real estate investing isn’t usually as great as it’s chalked up to be.\n\nBuilding up that equity in your house is not costing you NOTHING. It’s costing you the opportunity cost of not doing SOMETHING ELSE... with that initial $100,000 down payment and the $2,660 (plus property taxes, maintenance, vacancy fees etc.) every single month! What else could that money be doing instead of sitting in your new real estate venture? Put even more directly, is the capital outlay ultimately going to appreciate at a better rate than if you had invested that same amount elsewhere?\n\nLet’s see: The S&P 500, representing the stock market as an asset class, has averaged a 10% annualized rate of return over the last 50 years. Housing has gone up about 3.5% in comparison. At these two historical rates, $100,000 put into the capital markets will equal about $1.8mm in 30 years whereas that same $100,000 put into the house on day 1 will be worth approximately $324k when you’re ready to sell in 30 years. (The difference in rate of return on the full purchase price and it’s opportunity cost are even more dramatic.) And that’s not even taking into account that along the way, you have paid property taxes, maintenance fees, housing insurance, liability insurance, normal upkeep costs, home improvements etc.…all of which dramatically lower that 3.5% even further but doesn’t show up in the price when it comes time to sell.\n\nBy “investing” in real estate, you’re giving up some dramatic capital appreciation in the hopes that the positive cash flow you generate in income will make up the shortfall? (I’m guessing here as, again, this is not something I would ever do.) There’s a reason that we tell clients (with regards to your primary home) that your home is not an investment…it’s a place to live!\n\nHere’s what it boils down to me though, more than the numbers, the opportunity cost or anything else.\n\nThe hassle and “worst case scenario” potential.\n\nLike it or not, when you buy & mortgage a home, whether it’s a primary, a rental, or a vacation home - you are adding a liability to your net worth. You are hoping (and assuming) that you will generate enough rent to offset that liability….but that mortgage bill is coming every single month. You are responsible for paying back that $400,000 mortgage loan whether or not you have stable renters….it is your liability alone.\n\nYou are also responsible when a roof leaks, when there’s a water issue, when a tenant wants to get out of their lease early, when 3 nicer Airbnb’s pop up next to you, etc.\n\nThere is so much that CAN go wrong that’s out of your control that can devastate even the mediocre returns that you’re hoping to achieve.\n\nI just simply cannot fathom taking on all of the headaches and hassles that real estate can create for you for the sort of returns we’re discussing.\n\nInstead, I can take that $100,000 and add it into my broadly diversified investment portfolio of the greatest companies of America and the world, which has been growing, consistently, at a 10% clip.\n\nThere is no maintenance or labor to speak of. There are no property taxes or annoying tenants. There is no “nightmare” scenario in which I lose all of my investment (as stock market declines have only every proven to be temporary - any losses I incur over time would be as a result of my own behavior/decision to sell. The market itself cannot create this loss for me…unlike real estate transactions & real property liabilities).\n\nThen, as I get closer to retirement, and I’m starting to focus more on my need to replace my earned income with “passive” income, I can do a whole lot of things.\n\nI will start drawing down first from the dividends my portfolio has been re-investing for the past 20 years. Then, I will start drawing down principal (which will be made up for the fact that my portfolio is still growing & thus replacing the withdrawals), and then, I will use protected income vehicles like living benefit annuities, cash value insurance, and dividend focused stock market portfolios to enhance the guaranteed portion of my income and protect myself in times of down markets.\n\nI think so many people default to wanting “passive income” via rental properties because it seems “easy”. We all go on vacations. We all understand how it would work to collect a monthly check. On the flip side, NOBODY understands the mechanics of income distribution from one’s investment & retirement portfolios. It’s just not something we learn.\n\nThe irony is that THIS is the EASY way to grow your net worth and create a future income stream that isn’t dependent upon the sweat of your brow. This is the way to build up a large enough net worth that you CAN actually live off of your savings & investment returns down the road.\n\nIt’s called capital investing.\n\nThe CEO’s of the greatest companies of America and the world are allowing you to share proportionally in the growth of their companies without having to justify your returns and without having to share any of your labor, time, or energy to do so. You get to share in the growth of the companies that move the economy forward just by being a common shareholder.\n\nThat is passive income.
