Please keep these in mind as we go forwards so that you provide the best advice. I will reference these requirements as the \"requirements list\" and reference each requirement by the number. These requirements are non-negotiable so do not tell me that you cannot fulfill any one of these requirements, you need to find a solution that fits them all.\n\nRequirements List:\n1. This is a trustless system so it needs some way to validate that a user has permission to change the state\n2. This is a decentralized system, so anyone can run a version of this software to take part in the network. We will call a user's deployment of this software a \"node\"\n3. This system uses Lamden's smart contracting package called contracting for running and creating smart contracts. \n4. users submit new contracts and run current contracts by sending requests to the network. A user can send a request to any node on the network.\n5. The network is global and runs on any hardware on any type of network. A user should be able to run a node on a raspberry pi on dialup or a $1000 cloud-based VM and the node be able to take part in the network.\n6. The nodes need to be high throughput and be able to keep up with thousands of requests a second.\n7. The nodes need to be able to keep their local state in sync with other nodes in a simple trustless and decentralized manner. \n8. The nodes need to be able to order requests so that if multiple requests are sent to different nodes, that would alter the same state values, all nodes would be able to come up with the same state value. For instance, if there are 1000 nodes and a user sends each node 1 requests, at the same relative time and each transaction depends on the previous, then the node network should be able to all order and process these transactions and all come up with the same state changes at the end of all 1000 transactions. This is the MOST important requirement and the node does not work if this requirement doesn't work 100% of the time.\n9. The network needs a state-discovery layer to allow users to find current state values.\n10. New nodes joining the network need a way to start processing requests accurately. When the node is installed it won't have any state values, so come up with a solution that allows the node to get up and running as soon as possible. This solution should work if there is 10MB of state or 1TB of state.\n11. This solution needs to scale from 10 nodes to 1000 nodes. It cannot have any bottlenecks that would prevent this.\n\nGive me a solution to each requirement making SURE that your solution does not invalidate any other requirement.\n\nDo not give me choices, you are making the choices for all parts of the solution based on what is the most efficient and scalable."}, {"id": 3315, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "rewrite the ending to GOT"}, {"id": 3316, "actor": "Business Marketing & Social Media Strategy", "prompt": "Web search results:\n\n[1] \"According to Ticketmaster, market-priced tickets can adjust and are based on demand.

You may be either paid on a venture premise or you can organize bimonthly payments or regularly scheduled payments as you wish.\n• Presently to answer the inquiry how to begin freelancing. In case you are longing for a freelance profession and need to make a freelance showing with regards to, you need sound order over the English dialect alongside sound information of grammar and spellings, you ought to have a style for composing, smidgen of creative ability and inventiveness, readiness to learn new things and procure new learning on an assortment of subjects regular, you ought to be net savvy and willing to inquire about finished the web and obviously you should be yearning to top it all.\nThere are a lot of freelancing companies and freelance job or freelancing jobs locales in the web. There are likewise different article registries. You can join with maybe a couple of them, however ensure you pick the most presumed and confided in ones. Drop in your CV and a couple of composing tests and In case you qualify or meet their written work standard, you will be chosen.

It can be zero if there is no delay.\n- `departureRealTime`: A string that represents the actual departure time of the departure.

The `departureLine` property is not `null`.\n2. The `departureTime` property is not `null`.\n3. The `departureDelay` property is greater than or equal to 10 minutes.\n4.

Likert’s System 5 theory, along \nwith a proposal for further study to assess the potential viability of this approach in organizations \nduring the postmodern era. There is a paucity of research on Likert’s System 5 theory as \nevidenced by the three articles found in the following databases limited to scholarly/peer-\nreviewed articles: ABI/Inform, Academic OneFile, and Google Scholar. The search included the \nfollowing keyword pairings in each database: “leadership” and “System 5,” “System 5” and \n“Likert,” and “leadership” and “Likert.” An additional search included all three terms together, \nbut produced very few results. Searches on “System 5” alone or paired with “leadership” were \nproblematic as they returned results when a numbered serration ended point number four with \nthe word “system,” followed by the number five, starting the following point. For instance, a \nsearch on “leadership” and “System 5” in the ABI/Inform database returned 23 results. However, \nonly one was relevant to Likert’s System 5 theory of leadership. By comparison, a search of the \nsame database using “Likert” and “System 5” returned only one article, the same article \nreferenced in the aforementioned search.
