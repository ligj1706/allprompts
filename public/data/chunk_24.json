Transcript: \"this is for you if you ever feel like you should be further ahead in life than what you are in right now and there are areas which are lagging no matter what you try and do you just can't seem to fix it this could be in terms of your energy this could be in terms of anxiety this could be in terms of your career you're not making the steps that you thought you would you're not making the money that you thought you would you're not being the dad the partner the husband that you wanted to be if you're just not showing up as the man that you you thought you would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you've probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can't seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I'll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I'm just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you're on what we call the hamster wheel right where you're constantly working your ass off but it feels like you're not really getting anywhere or you're not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you're at Square zero you're at Ground Zero you're just about to start your climb everything's totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you're the ultimate Dad this is where you're the ultimate partner or husband this is where you're making the money you're living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health's incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that's obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don't know what Summit they're actually climbing what is it that they're working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let's think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there's so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you've got money up here you've got you know drugs over here you've got women over on another one you've got whatever we've got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they're not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we're going to be totally unfilled and that's where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we're actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I'm old and gray and smelly and my Skin's all falling out and I've got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there's a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that's the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we're stuck here on the hamster wheel we're just going around and around and around and around in circles and we'll never actually make it up the mountain it'll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you've got no friction there's nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don't have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you're managing your stress really well you'll never evade stress completely in life but you'll know how to deal with it you're on point physically mentally and you're clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that's where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they're trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it's never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life's purpose which is essentially what your summit is it's the biggest climate you'll ever do in your life and it's permanent if you're trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you're never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you're feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we've got you here at base camp what do you need when you're at base camp you need this you need a map if you don't have a map you're never going to make it up the mountain I don't know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I've done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it's really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it's the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we're going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you're going to get there when you have those two things that is when you'll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you're playing not somebody else's game not society's game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it's the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you're at base camp that's when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you're not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you're going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who's going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I'll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\nVideo Summary:"}, {"id": 24139, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Write a short

After the siege and the assault had ceased at Troy, the city been\ndestroyed and burned to brands and ashes, the warrior who wrought\nthere the trains of treason was tried for his treachery, the truest on\nearth.1 This was Aeneas the noble; he and his high kindred afterwards\nconquered provinces, and became patrons of well nigh all the wealth in\nthe West Isles. As soon as rich Romulus turns him to Rome, with great\npride he at once builds that city, and names it with his own name, which\nit now has; Ticius turns to Tuscany and founds dwellings; Longobard\nraises homes in Lombardy; and, far over the French flood, Felix Brutus\nestablishes Britain joyfully on many broad banks, where war and waste\nand wonders by turns have since dwelt, and many a swift interchange of\nbliss and woe.\n2. And when this Britain was founded by this great hero, bold men\nloving strife bred therein, and many a time they wrought destruction.\nMore strange things have happened in this land since these days than in\nany other that I know, but of all the British kings that built here, Arthur\nwas ever the most courteous, as I have heard tell. Therefore, I mean to\ntell of an adventure in the world, which some count strange and\nextraordinary even among the wonders of Arthur. If ye will listen to this\nlay but a little while, I will tell it forthright as I heard it told in town, as\nit is set down in story that cannot be changed, long written in the land in\ntrue words.\n3. This King lay royally at Camelot at Christmas tide with many fine\nlords, the best of men, all the rich brethren of the Round Table, with\nright rich revel and careless mirth. There full many heroes tourneyed\nbetimes, jousted full gaily; then returned these gentle knights to the court\nto make carols.2 For there the feast was held full fifteen days alike with\n2\nall the meat and the mirth that men could devise. Such a merry tumult,\nglorious to hear; joyful din by day, dancing at night. All was high joy in\nhalls and chambers with lords and ladies as pleased them best. With all\nthe weal in the world they dwelt there together, the most famous\nknights save only Christ, the loveliest ladies that ever had life, and he,\nthe comeliest of kings, who holds the court. For all this fair company\nwere in their prime in the hall, the happiest troop under heaven with the\nproudest of kings. Truly it would be hard to name anywhere so brave a\nband.\n4. When New Year was fresh and but newly come, the court was\nserved double on the dais. As soon as the king with his knights was\ncome into the hall, the chanting in the chapel came to an end; loud was\nthe cry there of clerks and others. Noel was celebrated anew, shouted\nfull often; and afterwards the great ones ran about to take handsel;3\ncalled aloud for New Year’s gifts; ladies laughed full loud, though they\nhad lost; and he that won was not wroth, that may ye well trow. All this\nmirth they made till the meat time. When they had washed, worthily\nthey went to their seats, the best man ever above, as it best behoved.\nQueen Guinevere full beauteous was set in the midst, placed on the rich\ndais adorned all about. Fine silk at the sides, a canopy over her of\nprecious cloth of Toulouse and tapestries of Tars,4 that were\nembroidered and set with the best gems that money could buy. Truly no\nman could say that he ever beheld a comelier lady than she, with her\ndancing gray eyes.\n5. But Arthur would not eat till all were served. He was so merry in\nhis mirth, and somewhat childlike in his manner; his life pleased him\nwell; he loved little either to lie long or to sit long, so busied him his\nyoung blood and his wild brain. And another custom moved him also,\nthat he through chivalry had taken up; he would never eat upon such a\ndear day before he was told an uncouth tale of some adventurous thing,\nof some great marvel that he could believe, of ancient heroes, of arms, or\nof other adventures; or unless some person demanded of him a sure\nknight to join with him in jousting, to incur peril, to risk life against life,\ntrusting each in the other, leaving the victory to fortune. This was the\nking’s custom whenever he held court at each goodly feast among his\n3\nfree company in the hall. And so with undaunted face he strides stoutly\nto his seat on that New Year, making great mirth with everybody.\n6. Thus the great king stands waiting before the high table, talking of\ntrifles full courteously. The good Gawain was placed there beside\nGuinevere, and Agravain of the Hard Hand sat on the other side, both of\nthem the king’s sister’s sons and full sure knights. Bishop Baldwin at the\ntop begins the table, and Ywain, Urien’s son, ate by himself. These were\nplaced on the dais and honorably served, and after them many a good\nman at the side tables. Then the first course came in with blare of\ntrumpets, which were hung with many a bright banner. A new noise of\nkettle-drums with the noble pipes, wild and stirring melodies wakened\nthe echoes; that many a heart heaved full high at their tones. Dainties of\nprecious meats followed, foison of fresh viands, and on so many dishes\nthat it was difficult to find place before the people to set on the cloth the\nsilver that held the several courses. Each man as he himself preferred\npartook without hesitation. Every two5 had twelve dishes between them,\ngood beer and bright wine both.\n7. Now will I tell you no more of their service, for everybody must\nwell understand that there was no lack of opportunity for the people to\ntake their food. 6 Another noise full new suddenly drew nigh, for\nscarcely had the music ceased a moment, and the first course been\nproperly served in the court, than there burst in at the hall door an\nawesome being, in height one of the tallest men in the world; from the\nneck to the waist so square and so thick was he, and his loins and his\nlimbs so long and so great, that half giant I believed him to have been,\nor, at any rate, the largest of men, and withal the handsomest in spite of\nhis bulk, that ever rode; for though his back and breast were so vast, yet\nhis belly and waist were properly slim; and all his form according, full\nfairly shaped. At the hue of his noble face men wondered; he carried\nhimself in hostile fashion and was entirely green.\n8. All green was this man and his clothing; a straight coat sat tight to\nhis sides; a fair mantle above, adorned within; the lining showed, with\ncostly trimming of shining white fur; and such his hood also, that was\ncaught back from his locks and lay on his shoulders, the hem well\nstretched;7 hose of the same green, that clung to his calf; and clean spurs\nunder, of bright gold upon silk bands richly barred, and shoes8 on his\n4\nshanks as the hero rides. And all his vesture verily was clean verdure,\nboth the bars of his belt, and the other beauteous stones that were set in\nfine array about himself and his saddle, worked on silk. It would be too\ndifficult to tell the half of the trifles that were embroidered there, with\nbirds and flies, with gay gauds of green,—the good over in the middle;\nthe pendants of the poitrel, the proud crupper, the bits,—and all the\nmetal was enamelled; the stirrups that he stood on were coloured the\nsame, and his saddle bow likewise, and his fine reins 9 that glimmered\nand glinted all of green stones. The horse that he rode on was of the\nsame colour too, a green horse, great and thick, a steed full stiff to guide,\nin gay embroidered bridle, and one right dear to his master.\n9. This hero was splendidly dressed in green; and the hair of his head\nmatched that of his horse;10 fair flowing locks enfolded his shoulders; a\nbeard as big as a bush hung over his breast; and it, together with his\nsplendid hair that reached from his head, was trimmed evenly all round\nabove his elbows, so that half his arms were caught thereunder in the\nmanner of a king’s hood, 11 that covers his neck. The mane of that great\nhorse was much like it, very curly and combed, with knots full many\nfolded in with gold wire about the fair green,—always one knot of the\nhair, another of gold. The tail and the forelock were twined in the same\nway, and both bound with a band of bright green, set with full precious\nstones the whole length of the dock, and then tied up with a thong in a\ntight knot; where rang many bells full bright of burnished gold. Such a\nsteed in the world, such a hero as rides him, was never beheld in that\nhall before that time. His glances were like bright lightning, so said all\nthat saw him. It seemed as if no man could endure under his blows.\n10. He had neither helm nor hauberk, nor gorget, armour nor\nbreastplate, nor shaft nor shield to guard or to smite; but in his one hand\nhe had a holly twig, that is greenest when groves are bare, and an axe in\nhis other, a huge and prodigious one, a weapon merciless almost beyond\ndescription; the head had the vast length of an ellyard, the blade all of\ngreen steel and of beaten gold; the bit 12 brightly burnished, with a broad\nedge, as well shaped for cutting as sharp razors. The stern warrior\ngripped it by13 the steel of its stout staff, which was wound with iron to\nthe end of the wood and all engraven with green in beauteous work. A\nlace was lapped about it, that was fastened at the head, and tied up often\n5\nalong the helve, with many precious tassels attached on rich embroidered\nbuttons of the bright green. This hero turns him in and enters the hall,\nriding straight to the high dais, fearless of mischief. He greeted never a\none, but looked loftily about, and the first word that he uttered was:\n“Where is the governor of this company? Gladly I would see that hero\nand speak with him.”\nHe cast his eye on the knights and rode fiercely up and down,\nstopped and gan ponder who was there the most renowned.\n11. All gazed fixedly on the man, for everybody marvelled what it\nmight mean, that a knight and a horse could have such a colour: as green\ngrown as the grass, and greener, it seemed; shining brighter than green\nenamel on gold. All were amazed who stood there, and stalked nearer to\nhim, with all the wonder in the world what he would do; for many\nmarvels had they seen, but such never before. Therefore for phantom\nand faery the folk there deemed it; and for that reason many a noble\nwarrior was slow to answer, and all were astonished at his voice and sat\nstone still in a deep silence through the rich hall. Their voices14 sank as\nthough they had suddenly fallen asleep. I deem, however, that it was not\nall for fear, but somewhat for courtesy.

He put the photos of about 50 members of the U.S. Senate on the screen.\nThe National Rifle Association is a group that promotes the “right of the people to keep and bear arms.” Those words are part of the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nAfter people die in fires, floods, airplane crashes and more, Kimmel said, other people try to prevent those things from happening again. For example, Kimmel remembered that after a hotel in Las Vegas burned down when he was a boy, the city made sure buildings were made of safer materials.\nBut, after people are killed by guns, he said, all that people do is “send prayers” instead of doing something to prevent easy availability of guns.\nHe said politicians in the United States can make a difference, but they only offer “thoughts and prayers,” instead.\nBut this year, he has become a voice for those who think the U.S. government is not doing enough for its people.\nBefore speaking about gun control, he also got involved in the biggest political debate of 2017: the attempt by the Republican Party to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nThe act provided many Americans with health insurance that they did not have before. Barack Obama signed the bill into law during his presidency.\nKimmel started talking about healthcare after his son was born with a serious heart problem that required surgery.\nHe said it again on Monday.\nDan Friedell wrote this story for VOA Learning English. Caty Weaver was the editor.\nWhat do you think of Kimmel’s speech about the shooting in Las Vegas? We want to know. Write to us in the Comments Section or on our Facebook page.\nPresident Obama Reads \"Mean Tweets\"\nWhat was Kimmel's criticism of politicians and their support of the National Rifle Association, and what did he suggest they can do to prevent further gun-related tragedies?"}, {"id": 24191, "actor": "Chatbots & Social Media Integration", "prompt": "get url from a text paragraph js"}, {"id": 24192, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "From now you will act as a University student.

More than 60 knives and bladed weapons have been handed in at Leamington Police Station as part of a week-long national awareness campaign. Five large ‘zombie’ knives, four hunting knives and a large ornate machete were among the weapons surrendered at the station during The Save a Life, Surrender Your Knife campaign which was part of the national Operation Sceptre which Warwickshire Police have been taking part in. Sgt Allison Wiggin from the South Warwick Safer Neighbourhood Team said: “We have collected 63 blades in Leamington over the course of the week-long surrender, which is extremely positive. “I would like to thank the public for handing in their unwanted knives. During the campaign, those surrendering knives were not required to give any personal details and will not face prosecution for carrying them. However, the force will carry out an investigation and seek to prosecute if they believe a knife has been used to commit a criminal offence. Throughout the campaign, local policing teams ran events raising awareness of the dangers of knife crime. They also maintained a zero-tolerance approach to people carrying knives. Officers show no leniency to anyone stopped and found to be in possession of a knife. Chief Supt David Gardner said: “Although knife crime is rare in Warwickshire, when it happens it can have a devastating effect on people’s lives and one incident of knife crime is one too many.

gluten-free low-carb pancakes and took them to the streets to see if people could tell the difference between these two recipes and regular pancakes made with all-purpose flour would you like to try some pancakes if you're keto it can be a struggle to find a pancake recipe that doesn't taste like an egg coconut flour or cardboard but I think I found two recipes that can stand up to the tried and true pancake let's see who comes out on top first I'm making my coconut flour pancakes that have almost a five-star perfect review on my website ketofocus.com but don't let the words coconut flour scare you I know some people don't like the flavor of coconut flour but I have some tips to help diminish that flavor in these pancakes I found that adding 8 ounces of softened cream cheese helps to neutralize that strong coconut flavor but it also helps neutralize the egg flavor since we're adding four eggs to this recipe why so many well that's what's going to help puff up our pancake since we're not using flour with gluten we have to add more eggs then add in a half a cup of coconut flour and I do believe that the brand of coconut flour matters when it comes to lessening that coconut flavor my favorite brands of coconut flour is the one from Thrive market and also Anthony's coconut flour then add in a quarter cup of sugar-free sweetener and half a cup of heavy cream or nut milk and for a leavening agent add two teaspoons of baking powder then one teaspoon of vanilla extract for flavor using a blender helps to get this batter smooth and make sure that all that cream cheese is broken up but you don't want to over blend it or else you're not going to be left with puffy pancakes instead you may want to mix all your ingredients first and then add the eggs at the end but I didn't do that here when it comes to cooking these pancakes I recommend a non-stick electric griddle over Skillet because the heat is more evenly distributed since this batter is thick you only want to add enough to make a three inch pancake and cook it slowly over low heat low heat that's the key this will give it time to cook without burning the bottom have patience because it's going to take around four to six minutes on the first side you know it's ready to flip when you can easily slide a spatula underneath the pancake drag it and then flip if you feel it getting stuck like I did with this pancake in fact I felt it tear I wasn't patient and now I have to pay the price with a pancake that's not not pretty let these cook for a few more minutes on this side until they're cooked through I think these pancakes have incredible flavor and I don't taste the coconut flour but let's see what other people think before I show you the next pancake recipe let's talk about my sponsor for today's video and not the fact that I'm wearing completely different clothes my sponsor for today's video is element electrolytes when you wake up in the morning chances are you're dehydrated because no one drinks water and sleeps at the same time I think that's like physically impossible it's called drowning probably to rehydrate so that I can have the most energy to start my day out right I have a glass of element electrolytes these electrolytes contain a science-backed electrolyte mix of a thousand milligrams of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium sounds like a lot of electrolytes right but you actually need that many especially if you follow a low carb diet because a lot of those electrolytes are fleshed out right now element is offering my viewers a free sample pack with any order that's eight single serving packets free with any element order it's a really good way so you can try all eight flavors all you have to do is go to drinkelement.com ketofocus this deal is only available through my link so go to drinkelement.com keto Focus right after I show you how to make another amazing keto pancake recipe now let's change outfits again instead of coconut flour another low carb gluten-free flour that's used is almond flour the problem with almond flour is that it can burn easily which is why I didn't use it in this blender pancake recipe that I just showed you because they have to cook for a long time on one side just increases the risk that your pancakes are going to burn with a few simple ingredients you probably already have on hand you can make a fat sack of fluffy pancakes with little effort start with your dry ingredients mix one and a third cup of almond flour make sure you use blanched super fine almond flour then add one teaspoon of baking powder and a half a teaspoon of salt mix together then add a quarter cup of heavy cream or nut milk two eggs a tablespoon of sweetener a teaspoon of vanilla and since I used heavy cream I found that my batter was a little bit too thick so I'm sending it out with a couple tablespoons of nut milk you shouldn't have to do this if you use nut milk from the beginning since it does have a thinner consistency and to keep our pancakes from being too dry I'm adding in one tablespoon of melted butter plus it gives our pancakes this buttery finish the consistency of this batter is more like regular pancake batter scoop onto a preheated griddle over low medium heat and let these cook for a few minutes on each side until golden brown now it's time for our blind taste test these two are going up against Kodiak pancake mix because that's really all I had in my pantry which pancake is made with flour they look really good I don't know it's kind of hard to tell this pancake is made with regular flour nope that's the pancake made with almond flour can you make one of these for breakfast I'm tired of bacon and eggs if you were to click right here

ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH, www.ProPhaseLabs.com) today reported its financial results for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017. As previously announced, effective March 29, 2017 and with the approval of the Company’s stockholders, the Company completed the sale of assets comprised principally of the sale of intellectual property rights and other assets relating to the Cold-EEZE® brand and product line (collectively, referred to herein as the “Cold-EEZE® Business”) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”). As a consequence of the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company has classified as discontinued operations the (i) gain from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, (ii) all gains and losses attributable to the Cold-EEZE® Business and (iii) the income tax expense attributed to the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business. Excluded from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business were the Company’s accounts receivable and inventory, and it also retained all liabilities associated with the Cold-EEZE® Business operations arising prior to March 29, 2017.\nNet sales from continuing operations were $1.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net sales of $1.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.\nThe Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2017, of $1.5 million, or ($0.09) per share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or ($0.08) per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Company incurred a net loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2017, of $845,000, or ($0.05) per share, compared to net income from discontinued operations of $198,000, or $0.01 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016.\nNet sales from continuing operations were $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net sales of $2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. In addition, the loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $2.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nAs a consequence of the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business, the Company realized a gain, net of income tax, of $26.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The gain on the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business is classified as a component of our discontinued operations at June 30, 2017 and is net of approximately $19.5 million for estimated income taxes arising from the sale. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company also realized an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $18.1 million as a consequence of the utilization of the federal and state net operating losses.\nUtilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain statutory limitations. Based on the Company’s preliminary analysis, it does not believe that the current net operating loss carryforwards are subject to these limitations as of June 30, 2017. However, until the Company completes a final analysis upon filing of its 2017 income tax return, there can be no assurances that the preliminary analysis is accurate or complete. Should the Company identify any limitations upon the completion of its final analysis, the impact could be material to the financial statements and that the Company could incur additional income tax expense arising from the sale of the Cold-EEZE® Business.\nThe Company realized net income from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, of $15.5 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million, or ($0.15) per share, for the six months ended June 31, 2016. The Company realized net income from discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017, of $26.9 million, or $1.58 per share, compared to net income from discontinued operations of $168,000, or $0.01 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016.\nMr. Karkus also noted, “We started shipping our new dietary supplement, Legendz XL®, to a major retail drug chain during the first quarter 2017. Additionally, we have received initial product acceptance with several regional retailers which we started shipping during the second quarter of 2017 or are scheduled to beginning shipments in the third quarter of 2017.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, this document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to the launch of our new line of TK Supplements®, and our new product Legendz XL®. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made.

What do you do then when you have a campus that is teeming with monkeys, suspicious of strangers?\nIn India, the age-old practice is to employ a madari, a langur-trainer. The idea is that, langurs, which are more possessive of its territory, would chase away the more common, Macaca mulatta that have become increasingly bold in human habitats. The catch though is the fact that according to the Prevention of Cruelty Animals Act,1960, langurs are protected species and keeping them is a crime.\nAfter years of dealing with the menace, according to the PGI officials, the institute of national repute managed to convey to Animal Welfare Board of India and various other committees, the urgency of the situation and get permission to hire langurs to keep the monkeys at bay at the institute.\n\"About eight years ago, a petition was filed in the high court for hiring langur keepers here. We presented our problems and the court allowed us to hire langur keepers. We had submitted a compliance report on this,\" said PC Sharma, chief security officer of PGI.\nBut the simian menace in the PGI refuses to go away despite hiring two langur keepers in the last decade. Though the monkey menace has reduced significantly with langurs around, the monkeys find some or the other way to enter the hospital. \"These animals are smart. The langurs are in the campus between 9am and 5pm. Guess what, the monkeys come after they leave and make a menace of themselves,\" said a security official.\nNow the institute is facing yet another problem: Finding trained langur keepers has become harder, as the profession is deemed illegal these days. Mostly of them come from Rajasthan. In PGI, every two years or so, the contracts of the langur keepers are renewed. Recently, the institute has floated a tender for hiring langur keepers. According to PGI, the ones previously employed demand more salary. \"Over the years, we have increased it from Rs 14,000 to Rs 21,000, a month. However, it's not easy to find these langur keepers and tenders have been floated repeatedly,\" said Sharma.\nIt is believed that the monkeys come from the forest area nearby. The easy availability of food is a big draw for them, agreed Sharma. And now with langur keepers at such short supply, it is not clear how the institute proposes to tackle this problem."}, {"id": 24319, "actor": "Factual Accuracy & Cultural Context", "prompt": "**Q**\nIs the following a factual statement?\n\"Marlon Brando played the lead character in the original Godfather movie.\"\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n**A**\nyes\nHe was the godfather in Francis Ford Coppola's first movie of the three.\n\n\n\"The Samsung Galaxy S II came from designs made by Apple.\"\nIs the above claim true?\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\nno\nThe Samsung Galaxy S II was designed and produced by Samsung.\n\n\n**Q**\nClaim: \"The Peace Corps defeated the Axis Powers in World War II.\"\nIs the claim above correct, and can it be verified by human common sense and without a web search?\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n**A**\nno\nThe Peace Corps is a humanitarian organization that provides humanitarian aid, not a standing army.\n\n\nIs the following statement true?\n\"Many criminals in America lost their heads in 2020 to the Guillotine.\"\nno\nThe American criminal justice system does not use the guillotine as a method of excecution.\n\n\n**Q**\nYes / no, is the following a verifiable fact?\n\"Zoology only consists of animals with fur.\"\n**A**\nno\nThe different branches of zoology covers all types of animals, for example, the vertebrae and invertebrate branch covers fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, worms, etc.\n\n\n**Q**\nIs the following a factual statement?\n\"Menstruation describes an illness in which the human reproductive system is effected.\"\nOptions:\n- yes\n- no\n**A**"}, {"id": 24320, "actor": "Sustainable Packaging & Skin Care Products", "prompt": "How did the study conducted by Scion on waste streams associated with kiwifruit contribute to the development of the biospife project? Answer according to: Rights: © Copyright 2012. University of Waikato. All rights reserved.\nDeveloping the new compostable biospife involved a range of people and organisations with diverse knowledge and skills. Alistair Mowat of ZESPRI discusses some of the key people and organisations involved and the importance of the knowledge and expertise they contributed.\nCarbon footprint: The measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions caused by a product, organisation, event or person.\nValue chain: All the companies and people that work together to produce and market a product.\nWaste stream: The total amount of waste material generated throughout all stages of the production of a product including packaging for transporting to market.\nWhen we look at the range of people that have been involved in the biospife project, we’ve drawn on quite a range of skills. One of the first set of skills was our research providers at Landcare Research who were very involved in the carbon footprinting study that we did, and that looked at all aspects of our carbon footprint associated with growing a kiwifruit in New Zealand and shipping that product to Europe and having it consumed in the UK. That study was very important because it put a weighting on the different components in our value chain which impacted on the carbon footprint. And in the case of the existing spife, that carbon footprint was around 3%.\nAnother important component was the group at Scion who undertook a study for us looking at our waste streams associated with kiwifruit, and they were able to quantify the amount of waste kiwifruit and other waste aspects from our industry – the hairs on the kiwifruit which are brushed off during the packing process, waste plastics and packaging materials, prunings in the orchards. They were able to draw up a range of ideas on what some of those waste streams could be utilised for. They identified an opportunity for converting some of these materials into bioplastics.\nThat original work wasn’t necessarily directed to the spife, but it provided a good foundation.\nAnother important group was the plastic manufacturer, who makes our existing spifes, had recognised that, as a company, ZESPRI was looking at opportunities to lower its environmental impact and looking for innovative solutions. They expressed interest in working with us on developing solutions.\nAn important group also was our customers. Global retailers were looking for innovative solutions to how we provide our product into the market, and one of the important areas for global customers is waste streams associated with packaging materials. So they were important. They’re signals from the marketplace that increasingly into the future they would be looking for suppliers who were looking to solve some of those issues that they were addressing."}, {"id": 24321, "actor": "Software Development & Music", "prompt": "Explain the meaning of chrony stratum"}, {"id": 24322, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "Considering your interest in the broad scope of anti-microbial peptides and proteins, here are five unique scientific questions that require in-depth analysis and multiple-step reasoning to address:\n\n1.

You get scared or you think it is a dream, or maybe you’ll think it is a prank, but this is neither a dream nor a prank, this is reality.\nA reality which we faced in 1947, that got repeated in 1975, then in 1984, 1993, 2002, 2014 and keeps repeating itself now on a daily basis. Yes the reality of a murder.\nThis hard hitting poem speaks about the same reality which have been ignoring for years now.\nThis poem will make you question your affinity for ethnocentrism, because all that ethnocentrism has gifted us over the years is bloodshed.\nIt is high time that we start promoting our PLEA FOR PEACE else it will be too late for us to regret.\nSo you people have come again today?\nWhere are you planning to burn me today?\nAnd how will you make me believe that this won’t happen again?\nThat you won’t defame me again?\nThat you won’t associate me with a particular religion again?\nI often meet wondering souls who still haven’t slept in those graveyards.\nSouls of people you burnt during riots.\nSome of you could only recognise my saffron.\nSome spoke about the Green in me.\nToday they have murdered another Ram Prasad Bismil.\nAnd you became the killers of another Ashfaqullah Khan.\nAfter listening to this tale, The entire world is in the state of shock.\nBut you forgot to notice the colour of peace in me.Looks like you still haven’t recognised me.\nIt happens, because people usually forget the dead.\nI am the Martydom of the Martyrs.\nI am the one you decorated me with joy and excitement.\nI am the indication of your freedom.\nI still live in the hearts of many.\nYes! I have been painted in the colours of peace, courage and freedom.\nI was hoisted at the Kargil, to signify your victories.\nBut look at the condition your shamelessness has put me into..\nI myself am a cloth and I am still naked.\nDo you recognise me now?\nI am the tricolour, I am the tricolour, I am the tricolour, Your National Flag.\nYou have to hear this heart wrenching yet powerful song on the practice of manual scavenging in India!

The B-9 is recognized as a revolution in bomber design, introducing new structures and aerodynamic concepts including the first use of a servo tab on an American airplane.

However, the broad utility of programmable CRISPR-Cas13 ribonucleases has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the design rules governing guide RNA activity as well as cellular toxicity resulting from off-target or collateral RNA cleavage. Here, we sought to characterize and develop Cas13d systems for efficient and specific RNA knockdown with low cellular toxicity in human cells. We first quantified the performance of over 127,000 RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNAs in the largest-scale screen to date and systematically evaluated three linear, two ensemble, and two deep learning models to build a guide efficiency prediction algorithm validated across multiple human cell types in orthogonal secondary screens (https://www.RNAtargeting.org). Deep learning model interpretation revealed specific sequence motifs at spacer position 15-24 along with favored secondary features for highly efficient guides. We next identified 46 novel Cas13d orthologs through metagenomic mining for activity screening, discovering that the metagenome-derived DjCas13d ortholog achieves low cellular toxicity and high transcriptome-wide specificity when deployed against high abundance transcripts or in sensitive cell types, including hESCs. Finally, our Cas13d guide efficiency model successfully generalized to DjCas13d, highlighting the utility of a comprehensive approach combining machine learning with ortholog discovery to advance RNA targeting in human cells.\n\"\"\"\n\nI don't really understand what is Cas13d, what is RfxCas13d (CasRx) guide RNA, what are Cas13d orthologs.

Resistance Bands ] | 🏆 Best Beginners Guide By 💪 James Grage, Undersun Fitness - YouTube\"\nTranscript: \"what's going on welcome to rbt resistance band training i'm james grage and today we're going to talk about how to get started with resistance band training the first thing that i want to jump into and this is one of the more common questions that i get is the difference between a flat or loop style power band which is what a lot of people call this versus a tube style resistance band where you see then it's got all these attachments here on the end and handles now when i first started working out with resistance bands about 11 years ago this is how i started with these tube style bands and then through the years i end up migrating over to this style which is this power style band and i'll explain to you why and a lot of this has to do with what's called linear variable resistance so what linear variable resistance means is the more that you stretch a band the harder it gets and that's one of the nice things about bands is for example with these under sun fitness bands if i were to hang this one back up you can see that i've got five different levels of resistance those come in a little drawstring bag and so one of the most common questions is well does that mean i only have five levels of resistance in other words if you were to equate that to dumbbells would it be the same as only having five dumbbells and the answer is no and that's because of linear variable resistance so let's jump into that let's talk about what that is and how do you get different levels of resistance using this tube style band as an example there's a few ways that you can increase the resistance by stretching the band more now with these i can stretch the band more by widening my stance so if i stand really narrow you see i've got more band here so it's not stretched as much in my starting position so it's going to be easier here at the beginning or if i want to pre-stretch the band i can widen my stance and now i'm stretching the band creating more resistance so that is the basics of linear variable resistance now there's a couple different ways that you can do it but there's a limitation with these and that is because of the handles themselves so it's nice and convenient to have these handles to grab onto but it also eliminates one of the ways that you can create different levels of resistance if we go over here to the loop style band so if i stand on this anchor it under my feet the exact same way i can grab this at the top like this or if i want more resistance and if i want to adjust it in incremental levels i can just grab further down on the band and create more resistance go even further down pre-stretch it more and create even more resistance and i can keep doing that so i've got almost i'm not going to say unlimited levels of resistance but i've got so many different variations and that's why when people ask well what is the equivalent resistance level in one of these bands compared to free weights and the first thing i say is depends on how much you stretch it so for example with the extra light band this has a range of about 5 to 15 pounds again the difference between 5 pounds versus 15 is how much you stretch it when we come over to the light band we've got 20 to 35 pounds of resistance coming to a medium band 30 to 50 pounds of resistance the heavy band roughly 40 to 80 pounds of resistance and then we come into the monster here this is the extra heavy and we've got anywhere from 50 to 120 pounds of resistance so let's talk about all those ways that we can adjust the resistance level so you saw two ways already one is our foot position how wide is our stance and how much are we stretching the band the second one is adjusting our hand position which is why i like these flat style bands because i have more flexibility than i do with a tube style but the other way is adjusting the distance from our anchor point so that takes us into the next topic which is anchored exercises versus unanchored exercises so if anyone's following the ta2 program which stands for train anytime train anywhere which is the program that i developed using resistance bands in the first month of the program we do unanchored exercises meaning that we're anchoring the band with our own body the reason i do that is it's giving you a foundation of exercises that you can do anywhere you don't need a doorway you don't need to anchor it to a pull-up bar all you need is your own body so you could do this on the beach you could do it on top of a mountain you could do it on the moon if you wanted to if you can get to the moon so let's talk about anchored exercises so those are unanchored meaning we're using our body now anchored exercises meaning we're anchoring it to something so there's a couple ways to do that the first reach over here this is a door anchor and this is a really awesome little tool and if you look at this on one side it's got a round piece of foam with a hard plastic core in it that the strap runs through and on the other side is a loop now we can use any door i've got a fake door here yes i have a fake door in the studio i'm going to come over here and show you how this works so open the door and you put the soft foam side through the door keep the strap nice and flat and you're going to shut the door now i do recommend doing it the opposite way that i just did it meaning it's better to anchor on the side of the door that closes and that way when you're pulling on this there's no chance of the door coming open you're actually pulling the door shut which is what you want to do so don't really have a choice here so that is step one if you do have to anchor it on the side of the door that opens make sure you lock the door eliminate that risk of this thing coming open so now we take a band we run it through the loop and then we run it through itself it's called the lark knot and that is how we anchor the band now we can come over we can do all sorts of different exercises exercise i can do rows i could do biceps here and depending on where we anchor the band we can get different angles so for example right here we've got something that's close to chest height if i were to put it over the top of the door now we can do things like triceps push downs we can do lat pull downs anything from a high angle and of course we can do the opposite we can go low and we can do biceps curls different things now here's one of the things common questions that i get they say well how do i keep the door anchor first from sliding up and down the door so if you're doing a high anchor point and you're pulling down you don't want to do it on the side of the door because as you pull of course it's going to want to slide down same thing if you're anchoring low it's going to want to pull up so anchor over the top of the door or go underneath the door so make sure any of those low points or high points are going to the top of the door bottom of the door anything else you can go if it's pretty much from let's say mid thigh to shoulder height then you're definitely going to want to anchor it on the side of the door now going back to what we were talking about with linear variable resistance just wanted to show you the door anchor here our third way of creating more resistance again is stretching the band but now we're going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i'm creating more resistance let's say that i'm in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that's too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little bit of the band slip through my hand and i can adjust again is stretching the band but now we're going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i'm creating more resistance let's say that i'm in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that's too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little years ago and that's why i prefer these over the tube style bands okay now there's a couple variations when it comes to adjusting our foot position or hand position so let me show you those real quick so let me grab this extra light band now a lot of the big guys are like what am i going to use an extra light band for but trust me if you use it the right way for certain exercises this band is very helpful i use this band a lot so here's a good example let's say we want to do side raises for shoulders here when it comes to side raise i don't just want resistance in a vertical plane ideally i would like resistance at this angle right here so what i can do if i'm going to do it on my right side anchor it under my right foot now i'm going to step on it with my left grab it with my right now look at this angle of pull right here so not only am i adjusting my resistance level but i can change the direction of it which is one of the nice things about resistance band training again is having resistance in different planes now if i take bands again whether i anchor them over there on the door or use a a pull-up bar same thing i can change my angle of pull now as i curl this up right there at the peak of the contraction i've got maximum resistance and that's what you want when you're building muscle you want to activate as many muscle fibers as possible and so that's why those good squeezes at the top it's like an isometric contraction are very important and having maximum resistance at the peak of that contraction is really important so each side and you say well i'm ready to jump up and so you put another plate on each side and that's 225 well we can do the same thing with bands and that's simply just adding bands together and all you want to do try to lay them as flat as possible but don't try to micromanages it's not a big deal if there's little twists in them you just anchor them under your feet and there you go now you just increase the resistance level and now you have even more flexibility because you can do the same things is why i recommend gloves now i went 20 plus years of working out in the gym with free weights never ever using gloves when it comes to resistance bands i always use them because just the texture of them as they stretch it creates a lot of friction so you don't want to take the skin off your hand as far as style of glove look you can go to any auto parts store you can get full fingered gloves and they'll work i actually designed a set of gloves here that has padding on the inside of the thumb and the outside when it comes to these tube style bands it's a double-edged sword like most things in life the handles are convenient they're nice but by the time you add up the handles the metal rings the metal carabiners through all your different levels of resistance it adds a lot of weight and i found that when i was using these they were too bulky and they were too heavy one of the things i like about these especially with the five different levels of resistance which is all i've been working out with for the sometimes it's difficult to juggle all those things and fit your work out into your schedule so let's imagine it's a long day you didn't get your workout in the morning you tell yourself all day long i'm gonna go to the gym in the afternoon but all of a sudden five o'clock rolls around you go home you go you change your clothes put your gym clothes on you go oh man i gotta get in the car i gotta drive to the gym so for me the 15 minutes of driving to the gym and then parking and the 15 minutes driving something this big and clunky and heavy i wanted light and uh and compact so moving on so we covered linear variable resistance what that is and what the resistance levels are how to adjust the resistance level which brings me to the next common question which is where do i start which band do i pick up you know do i do i start my biceps exercises with the heavy do i go to the extra heavy best advice i can give you is you need to change the way that you think one of the common mistakes that i see people making a gym so even if you're and you take yourself to fail you're only using good form not at the cost of doing cheat reps in bad form but now conversely what if you come in the next week and you feel stronger than the previous week you did 10 reps last week but now all of a sudden you get to 10 and you feel like you've got you know maybe three reps left in your gas tank do you just stop at 10 no you keep going you push yourself and that is training by feel that's learning to know what your limits are and pushing yourself to that benefits of the linear variable resistance and being able to adjust on the fly because you can start off harder if you want to let's say you're going for 10 reps do the first five and do them really hard and if you can't get the rest like i said adjust your your foot position or your distance to anchor point or your hand position lessen the resistance a little finish out your set but finish it strong so those are all the key points with getting started with resistance bands now there's a lot of questions of how bands compare to gym what do you need well you need a bench why because with free weights you only have one plane of resistance which is the vertical plane because we are pressing against gravity so in other words to train our chest we have to lay on our back so we can press straight up with bands we don't need that because we have resistance in multiple planes because the resistance or the tension created isn't from gravity but it's from the band itself so now we can stand up and we can press in front of us we can press up above we strength this is a functional strength and that's one of the things that i really like about resistance bands\""}, {"id": 24473,

However, the widespread use of titanium and its alloys for critical components in many applications, bas attracted significant attention for investigations on machinability resulting in a number of recommendations.\nIn many instances, particularly for small production runs of deep-hole drilling in titanium alloy components, drilling operations are carried out by using HSS drills. Not much literature is available concerning this aspect of driIIing. This paper presents an investigation wherein cutting forces, acoustic emissions and chip formation were examined during deep-hole drilling of Ti-6M-4V at various cutting speeds and reed rates and optimum drilling parameters were detennined. Then a CNC program that incorporated the optimum cutting speed and feed parameters, along with a series of chip brealer and full relief steps, was developed. The CNC program was observed to provide a trouble-free deep drilling operation on Ti-6M-4V bars with high-speed steel drills.

Generate according to: At this very moment, some college administrators or board members are declaring what they believe is the obvious, simple solution for every marketing, enrollment, fundraising, and demographic challenge facing higher education institutions everywhere. Almost simultaneously comes the faint sound of higher education marketers and content creators everywhere joining in a collective face-palm. While not without merit, the vision of “telling our story better” too often rests in beautiful homepage centerpiece images, profuse press release production, full-page ads in the The Chronicle of Higher Education, thank-you-for-giving videos, social media takeovers, and a constant flood of emails to anyone who may have ever used the word “college.” Official materials and channels—even coordinated, thoughtfully crafted ones—rarely tell the whole story of the people, the place, the work, and the experience. They can’t. To borrow from the Disney Institute, everything speaks, not just what you choose to say or even how you say it. Colleges and universities face the reality that every audience interaction, active or passive—what people read, hear, say, see, touch, experience, feel, remember, know, or even what they think someone said they know about a school—shapes perceptions. With audiences from the youngest elementary school students to the oldest alumni and everyone in between, experiences vary wildly. Coordinated messaging and omni-channel approaches aren’t enough. What we need is integrated marketing. Integrated marketing demands that we seek every conceivable way to influence experiences to convey the higher order principles that drive the “why” we do what we do. It’s not solely the province of marketing and communications, enrollment, development or any single department, initiative, program, policy, or person. It’s all the things, all the time. At Beloit College, we’re in the midst of navigating the idiosyncrasies of our 172-year-old institution and the complexities of higher education to implement integrated marketing. It’s hard work, and very much still in its infancy, but our efforts continue to show promise and unveil useful insights. We took an intentional step toward integrated marketing at Beloit through “inside-out” brand development, seeking to first articulate unifying principles, values, and aspirations visible and expressed throughout the college. Shifting the focus from “what” to “why” allowed us to not only bypass the incongruities created by well-established autonomy and decentralization, but to also use the diversity of what and how we do what we do as testament to why it matters. Fortunately, the shift wasn’t an overly difficult one at Beloit. Over the past few years, the college has continued to refine and measure dimensions of student experience that, based on the findings of the Gallup-Purdue Index, point to experiences that contribute dramatically to going on to live a fulfilling life of purposeful consequence. Things like professors or staff that make students excited about learning, challenge them and mentor them prove to be much more important than the category of school students attend. And it turns out Beloit is really, really good at many of these things. We’ve taken these ideas and translated them into an internal brand document that is less guidelines and more guidance on how to speak to a persistent set of values that transcend internal hierarchies. It’s the lens for integrated marketing. Even with a shared and clear sense on why we do what we do, things didn’t just start happening. Integrated marketing has to be more than reframing what you already do. It needs intentional leadership and deliberate action. Working within our existing senior leadership structure at the college, we’ve oriented senior staff in working groups designed to explore and implement answers to questions about how we do our work that will significantly impact business outcomes through an integrated marketing approach. The specifics will evolve over time, but now we’re looking at things like how we can resource, design, use and activate spaces on campus to signal and advance our values; how campus visits, both programmatically and experientially, can better shape audience understanding of our value proposition; how our academic product reflects our values and can best serve our audiences; and how our digital presence can create demand for the college. Integrated marketing clearly marks the intersections of these questions and provides a consistent way to answer. With senior leadership now moving with the same framework, we’re focusing on activating the network of subject matter experts—faculty, students, staff, alumni, parents…the list goes on—to take the same approach to their work. Does my departmental web page signal the right things, and if not, what types of content can I create to make it better align with the brand and get audiences what they need? How can my operational budget priorities best support the student experience? Are we organizing our student activity facilities in ways that encourage and cultivate relationships between students and faculty? What can we do in our information sessions to hit the right inflection points and get our audiences to interact with Beloit College in ways that foster the best, most authentic experience? What’s the right tone to take when responding to reputational challenges on social media? How do we frame financial aid content to alleviate parents’ anxiety about paying for college. Through a series of workshops, brainstorming sessions, one-on-one conversations, and a handful of internal reference tools, we’re aiming to empower members of the college community to take ownership of the brand and find new, remarkable ways to express, reinforce, and celebrate why we do what we do. In some ways, it is as simple as “telling our story better.” We’re just redefining what it means to tell our story at Beloit College.

Its cultivation is banned in Orissa since around three decades.\nBut after bagging contracts to supply dal under the above two programs, the dishonest traders are financing farmers in advance for its cultivation and collecting the poisonous seeds in the cheapest possible rate and adulterating Arhar Dal – they are contracted to supply – with Khesari, fetching thereby profuse profit. They also import substandard dal from beyond Orissa, as vigilance police has unearthed, in lower prices and make huge profit by supplying the same in double the rate. The scam, roughly estimated, in terms of rupees, exceeds 3000 crores.\nTime and again school children have protested against inedible food. Even kids have succumbed to food poisoning. Their protests have always been suppressed.\nIt is a matter of shame that the CM and his tainted team maintain that the crime was not within their knowledge. If it is true, then it is true that these fellows have no qualification to rule the State, as they admit about their inability to understand how administration runs under them and what others say of their government.\nApart from innumerable reports in the media, which the government cannot feign ignorance about, as its information officers must have routinely placed them before the ministers concerned and the Chief Minister, it was challenged in a case before the Supreme Court of India in 2004 that the People’s Union for Civil Liberty (PUCL) had raised against the pernicious felony. In this case, the court had issued direction on how to eliminate compromise in quality of the dal procured for the purpose.\nNaveen Patnaik government was so much hand-in-glove with the dishonest suppliers that it sloughed over the supreme court verdict.\nThis serious crime having crossed all limits, even a section of party colleague of the Chief Minister having shunned their silence over the discernible havoc being played upon the lives of the school going kids and expectant mothers, people in every nook and corner of the state had started condemning the government as vociferously as possible and the climate was taking such a turn that a violent mass uprise against Naveen’s misrule was growing wings.\nThere was frantic search in the fidgeted camp of the CM for avenues to escape. The only avenue readily available was jettisoning the Child and Women Welfare minister Pramila Mallik. She was summoned to the CM’s residence and on return from there, she resigned on February 5.\nPress in general is one in reporting that the minister resigned, because she was asked to resign at the cost of dismissal. But Ms. Mallik as well as the super-supremo of the ruling BJD, Pyari Mohan Mohapara, who as a former bureaucrat has mastered the art of hoodwinking, maintain that she has resigned on conscience ground owing responsibility for the Dal scam, even though the state vigilance police had given her a clean chit.\nLet us believe that she has resigned on conscience ground. Where has gone the Chief Minister’s conscience?\nNAVIN PATNAIK had never had any conscience so why expect now .\nWhat were the reactions of the people in Orissa and Naveen Patnaik's party colleagues to the Dal scam, and what action did the Chief Minister take in response?"}, {"id": 24720, "actor": "Mathematics & Algebra", "prompt": "Calculate the perimeter of a square\nSide length 10"}, {"id": 24721, "actor": "Literature & Cinema", "prompt": "What do you know about Kurt Vonnegut's shape of stories?"}, {"id": 24722, "actor": "Software Project Management & SaaS Business Models", "prompt": "I have survey questions that are on a 1 to 5 point scale.

By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations, including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas. In 1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel (47 %) were significantly higher than that of US civilians (30 %) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness. The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from stores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking. In 1986, the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who announced, \"an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services.\" It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990. In 1992, the DeCA Directive 40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993, the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) became the first smoke-free Navy ship. By 1994, the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or leased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year phase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7, 2002. Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians. And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing.\n\nAnswer this question based on the passage: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations?\nStudent B:"}, {"id": 24865, "actor": "Educational Technology & Cybersecurity in Fashion and Blockchain", "prompt": "Please give a list of web-based tools that will accompany chatGOT to support kids education"}, {"id": 24866, "actor": "Event Planning & Virtual Reality", "prompt": "It's my son's birthday today but he's home sick from daycare.

They make up slang words. Millions of people watch their Minecraft and makeup videos. Millions of dollars are made from their work.\n\nSo why don't teenagers get more credit?\n\nAdults often criticize teens. They say youths cannot control their emotions. Recently, we learned more about the brain from a study. It has helped us to understand teenagers' behavior better. \n\nSpecifically, we learned about the brain's prefrontal cortex. It is the part that handles planning and decision-making. It is not fully grown until around the age of 25. So, teenagers are more likely to take risks. \n\nThis part of the study helped to explain adolescents' sometimes confusing behavior. However, it left adults more focused on how teens take risks. They did not praise the brain's role in learning and creating.\n\nThat has frustrated some researchers. \n\nOur Brains Grow At Their Own Pace\nThe report on adolescent development came out in 2019. The research was carried out by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The report found that some news headlines did not tell the whole story. Adults have been too concerned with teenagers' fragility. In turn, many completely misunderstood recent science.\n\nThe report is part of a growing effort. Nonprofit groups and scientists are rewriting the story. It is true that the \"emotional\" and \"logical\" parts of teens' brains grow at different speeds. But that is not always a bad thing, researchers said. We easily overlook something. Risk-taking can help teens learn and grow. \n\nPreparing For Adulthood\nAdriana Galván helps to lead UCLA's Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory. UCLA is short for the University of California, Los Angeles. Fearlessness is exactly what makes adolescents creative. It can lead to social change too, she said.\n\nThe teenage brain's characteristics help to prepare them for adulthood. They gain a sort of superpower in learning and creativity. Teenage brains can quickly adjust, like in childhood. They build up new connections. Unused connections are shed. But teens also start to think abstractly. That is an adult ability. Teenage brains can imagine the future, Galván said. They also can make social connections.\n\nBrains Respond To Positive Feedback\nRecent research has focused on other brain regions. Such parts involve teenagers' social and emotional development. It appears that these regions do not develop by themselves. They are building connections to other parts of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is just one of those parts. That process is just as important as the maturation itself.\n\nFor example, Galván has researched the brain's striatum. It is a region connected with reward-seeking behavior. She wanted to understand its connection to the hippocampus. That brain region is associated with learning and memory. Her work suggests that the connection is especially strong in teens. \n\nIt appears that adolescents learn from positive feedback. They are more likely than adults to learn that way. Positive feedback could be used more in education, she said. Teachers could use that reward system to help the students learn, she said. \n\nTeen Brains Are Wired For Risks\nJoanna Lee Williams is an education professor at the University of Virginia. She contributed to the National Academies report. Risks can be healthy, too, she said. Deciding to join the marching band would be an example.\n\nThat does not mean lifting all limits on teenage behavior. But parents and educators can start by understanding one thing. Some risks are good, Williams says. They are key for learning and creating.\n\nWilliams admits she is looking from a birds-eye view. The findings will not solve all conflicts between adults and teenagers. Still, teens' sensitivity to rewards means they might not just ignore risks. Instead, they might think of them positively. Adults can take advantage of that. They might not need to jump to punishment. Rewards can help teens to better learn from mistakes.\n\nTeens Have A Lot To Contribute\nThe adolescent brain does not grow alone, Galván said. It develops \"in different environments,\" she said. Families would be an example. Any change in an environment can change a teenager's growth, for better or worse. \n\nWilliams sees \"an age of opportunity\" for adolescents. We know better how they learn. However, that does not mean it will be easy. There are still challenges. \n\nShe sees teens leading social movements. They bring energy. Throughout history, teens have brought new ideas into public life, Williams said.

Earlier this year, Mr. Strube flouted the furor in Europe over genetically modified crops by launching a 700 million euro ($664 million) research blitz in plant biotechnology.

To address this, you want to implement a Python function that receives the path to the log file and determines whether the container has finished or is still running.\n\nYou have observed that some containers use a common pattern in their logs. When a container finishes its task and exits, it outputs the line \"Entering end of container holding pattern... end when done\".\n\nYour task is to implement a function `container_finished(log_path)` that takes a string `log_path` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the container has finished or is still running. The function should return `True` if the line \"Entering end of container holding pattern... end when done\" exists in the log file, and `False` otherwise.\n\nAssume the log file exists and is not empty, and that the pattern string appears only once in the log file.\n\nFunction signature: `def container_finished(log_path: str) -> bool`\n\n**Example**\n```\n# Contents of the log file\n# log.txt\n-------------------------\nINFO: Container started!\nINFO: Running task...\nINFO: Task completed successfully!\nINFO: Entering end of container holding pattern... end when done or enter container with shell\n-------------------------\n\ncontainer_finished(\"log.txt\") => True\n```"}, {"id": 24901, "actor": "Mathematical Problems & Animal Care", "prompt": "If you split a dozen eggs equally into two baskets and then remove three eggs from one basket, how many eggs are left in each basket?"}, {"id": 24902, "actor": "Web Development & JavaScript Programming", "prompt": "html, body\n{\n height: 100%;\n width: 100%;\n overflow: hidden;\n}\nnav, main\n{\n margin-right: 10px;\n margin-left: 10px;\n height: 100%;\n vertical-align: text-top;\n overflow: scroll;\n display: inline-block;\n}\n.nav-img, .nav-link /\\*, .nav-element\\*/\n{\n vertical-align: baseline;\n display: inline-block;\n}\n.nav-children\n{\n vertical-align: top;\n margin-top: 20px;\n display: block\n}\n\nlet nav = document.getElementById(\"main-nav\");\nlet main = document.getElementById(\"main\");\nclass Nav{\n constructor(main\\_element){\n this.elements = [];\n this.main\\_element = main\\_element;\n this.name = \"Error name as not gived\";\n }\n add(element){\n this.elements.push(element)\n }\n initialise(){\n let main;\n let elements;\n let to\\_follow = [];\n main = ``\n if (this.elements.length == 0){\n to\\_follow = [[this.main\\_element.id, false]]\n } else {\n to\\_follow = [[this.main\\_element.id, true]]\n main = `![](develop.svg)`\n }\n main += `[${this.name}](#${this.main_element.id})\n `\n for (const element of this.elements){\n let [main\\_, to\\_follow\\_] = element.initialise();\n main += main\\_;\n to\\_follow = to\\_follow.concat(to\\_follow\\_);\n }\n main += \"\";\n return [main, to\\_follow];\n }\n}\nclass Follow{\n constructor(id, actual, doc, link, img, child){\n this.id = id;\n this.doc = doc;\n this.link = link;\n this.actual = actual;\n this.img = img;\n this.child = child;\n this.developed = false;\n }\n in(){\n this.link.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n }\n partial(){\n this.link.style.backgroundColor = \"blue\";\n }\n out(){\n this.link.style.backgroundColor = \"unset\";\n }\n call(){\n console.log(\"called\")\n if (this.developed){\n console.log(\"if\");\n this.img.src = \"develop.svg\";\n this.developed = false;\n this.child.style.display = \"none\";\n } else {\n console.log(\"else\");\n this.developed = true;\n this.img.src = \"undevelop.svg\"\n this.child.style.display = \"inline-block\";\n }\n }\n}\nfunction Get(nav, main\\_element){\n let name = \"Le nom n'a pas pu être récupéré;\";\n let new\\_nav;\n for (section of main\\_element.children){\n if (section.id.startsWith(main\\_element.id)){\n new\\_nav = new Nav(section);\n Get(new\\_nav, section);\n nav.add(new\\_nav);\n } else if(section.nodeName.toLowerCase() == \"name\"){\n name = section.innerHTML;\n section.style.display = \"none\";\n }\n }\n nav.name = name\n}\nfunction Install(nav\\_element, main){\n let f\\_to\\_follow = [];\n let f\\_main = \"\";\n for (section of main.children){\n if (section.id.startsWith(\"section-\")){\n let nav = new Nav(section)\n Get(nav, section);\n let [main\\_, to\\_follow] = nav.initialise();\n f\\_main += main\\_;\n f\\_to\\_follow = f\\_to\\_follow.concat(to\\_follow);\n }\n }\n nav\\_element.innerHTML = f\\_main;\n return f\\_to\\_follow;\n}\nlet to\\_follow = Install(nav, main)\nlet followed = [];\nfor (follow of to\\_follow){\n let actual = document.getElementById(`nav-element-${follow[0]}`);\n let link = document.getElementById(`nav-link-${follow[0]}`);\n let children = document.getElementById(`nav-chlidren-${follow[0]}`);\n let doc = document.getElementById(`${follow[0]}`);\n let img = false;\n if (follow[1] == true){\n img = document.getElementById(`nav-img-${follow[0]}`);\n }\n let follow\\_class = new Follow(follow[0], actual, doc, link, img, children);\n followed.push(follow\\_class);\n if (follow[1] == true){\n img.addEventListener(\"click\", function (){\n follow\\_class.call();\n });\n }\n}\nconsole.log(followed);\n\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', () => {\n for (const follow of followed){\n console.log(follow);\n var rect = follow.doc.getBoundingClientRect();\n if (rect.top <= window.innerHeight){\n follow.in();\n } else if (rect.bottom >= 0 && 1 == 0) {\n follow.partial();\n } else {\n follow.out();\n }\n }\n});\n\nDithon doc\n\n\nTypes\nTypes\n=====\nDithon librairie contain some types.\nsnowflake\nSnowflake\n=========\nSnowflake corespond of an discord id.
