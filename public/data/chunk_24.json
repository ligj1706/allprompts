To varying degrees, digital transformation is taking place in every organization, of every size, in every industry, and across every sector. Whether we choose to embrace it or not is a different matter.\nThe technology that drives transformation is changing at a phenomenal rate, with capabilities increasing by an order of magnitude (10x) every few years. This has a huge impact our every-day lives, as well as the expectations of anyone who uses or works with technology.\nThe digital economy is, in essence, fundamentally changing the way IT must think about the applications and systems it oversees– the underlying infrastructure, and the people and processes required to support them. We must assume a digital transformation mindset as we develop the architectures, processes and skills required to support an interconnected, always on, instant access world.\nThe rapidly accelerating scale and complexity of application ecosystems necessitates that organizations surrender direct, moment-by-moment systems control to software automation that enables us to reserve human interaction for monitoring and management. If we want our companies and organizations to remain relevant, and to meet or exceed the expectations of the digital economy, IT itself must transform to deliver the efficiency, predictability and agility needed to run these increasingly complex systems. The best, fastest way to do this is to change to a cloud model.\nTransformation of the underlying processes and personnel.\nThese are not necessarily sequential phases, but rather distinct areas of development that must occur to create truly modern, future-ready IT.\nThe critical tenets of a modern infrastructure are that it must be trusted, that it leverage flash storage for the best possible efficiency and performance, and that it is optimized to be scale-out, software-defined, and cloud-enabled. This combination of features integrates security and data protection with high performance infrastructure components that use a common ‘building block’ approach.\nUtilizing policy-driven application and data mobility, as well as the ability to fully leverage both on- and off-premises resources and delivering maximum flexibility for both programmability and the infrastructure itself, the modern infrastructure is powerful, efficient, agile, and optimized to support cloud.\nBut modernization does not mean “rip and replace.” In fact, many organizations modernize different aspects of the IT infrastructure in phases to reduce disruption and budget pressures. And while it is possible to craft a modern infrastructure using disparate, and even existing server, storage or networking elements, the quickest, most efficient way to modernization is through the use of converged infrastructure, specifically hyper-converged infrastructures like VxRail, because these offerings are ready to deploy and are inclusive of all critical modernization aspects.\nThe next element expands on the foundational architectural components, enhancing manageability by reliably removing the dependency on human interaction from routine day to day activities, instead leveraging software and policy-driven automation. This phase is focused on orchestration and enabling an Application Program Interface (API)-driven environment. APIs are critical, as they allow infrastructure to be programmed rather than relying on manual control, moving us away from scripts, command line interfaces (CLIs) and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Once APIs are fully utilized, the possibility of human error is minimized and organizations can use orchestration tools to automate the delivery of infrastructure services. These processes are now easily repeatable, more predictable and more highly available.\nTo this point, we’ve been discussing technology, but the final element of IT transformation is ultimately the most critical– the refinement of new processes and the skills of IT personnel. Your team will likely need to acquire new skills to support the new model. This will enhance productivity and allow them to develop, refine and manage more applications at greater scale. Modern IT manages through policy to automate routine activities (such as provisioning) into seamless processes that provide automated, self-service capabilities, removing the need for cumbersome activities like IT tickets and siloed manual steps. This delivers a frictionless consumption experience to application owners, and ultimately accelerates business agility. Business agility allows greater innovation, as well as the ability to iterate quickly, delivering better customer experiences and ensuring competitiveness.\nThe true measure of the success of these modernization is in the end results. Dell EMC recently commissioned a study with analyst firm ESG, reaching out to thousands of IT executives and managers to gain greater insight into the results of these activities in real world environments. The resulting IT Transformation Maturity Study showed that organizations that have transformed IT operations are three times more likely to be ahead of schedule on new projects and are able to free up an additional 33 percent of budget for innovation as opposed to maintenance activities. These results demonstrate just how transformed organizations, specifically digitally transformed organizations, are able to be more future focused and far more efficient than organizations that continue to leverage legacy IT infrastructure, delivery models, and processes.\nWhile every organization is unique, there are clearly consistent parallels. Most are not able to transform every aspect of their IT operations all at once due to financial or resource constraints. However, those who have started the digital transformation journey are reaping the benefits. What matters most is that you begin now. Begin to plan. Begin to execute. Begin to transform.\nRobert Bradfield is a strategic campaign marketing director at Dell EMC."}, {"id": 3602, "actor": "Drone Logistics & Software Development", "prompt": "Debate the pros and cons of using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for project scheduling."}, {"id": 3603, "actor": "Legal & Government Affairs", "prompt": "Servicemembers have the right under the SCRA to terminate the lease of a motor vehicle if they enter into military service during the term of the lease.\n\nA.

The latter is a key service for business because although you may be able to operate the best restaurant with a unique menu offering and great décor and service, if you do not know how to market your business, you will depend on haphazard street traffic.\nIf you happen to have a high-traffic location, so much the better, but that is still local traffic. If your menu is that unique, you will not reach people who are willing to travel long distances, well outside of your street traffic reach, just to try a unique meal. Once impressed, they will tell their friends – still a very valuable and free marketing strategy – and become repeat customers; another free marketing strategy.\nThose free marketing techniques depend heavily on the quality of your business, but they are limited in their scope since they are one-to-one rather than one-to-thousands, or more, that is available through effective marketing strategies. If you do not have those marketing skills, fortunately, they can be employed. Here’s what to look for in quality marketing strategy services.\n1. Develop a concise business and marketing plan. Document it, because if you need a loan to start your business, this plan must be in writing. A proficient marketing strategy service will analyze your verbal plan and develop a concise business plan and a means to market it effectively.\n2. Highlight your strengths. A proficient marketing strategy will concentrate on developing the strengths you bring to your enterprise that set you apart from your competitors. If that is your unique menu, that strength should be positively exploited. Show us; don’t just tell us.\n3. Develop a multiple-distribution marketing strategy. A competent marketing strategy services will create a number of different marketing outlets: print, radio, TV, social media. The campaign may vary slightly depending on the media type. Flexible strategies are the hallmark of effective marketing strategies. Your potential patrons will be attracted by a variety of techniques; to ignore the media channels available will restrict your marketing reach.\n4. What is the wow factor? Are you sold by the strategies? Take yourself out of the box and be a potential consumer of your menu. Would you come to your restaurant and order a meal based on the media content of the marketing strategies? The number one customer great marketing strategy services must wow is you.\n5. Measure the response. The best marketing strategy services will not only create attention-grabbing media, but will have the expertise to measure the results. How many are responding to the campaign, how are they responding, and are they converting response to closing a business relationship? Are they buying your menu?\nEffective marketing strategy services will develop a great plan, highlight your strengths, create multiple media outlets, wow you and your customers and analyze customer response.\nHow important is documenting a concise business and marketing plan?"}, {"id": 3607, "actor": "Drone Logistics & Software Development", "prompt": "The objective in the well-known Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is to find a roundtrip of minimal total\nlength for a given a set of n nodes and distances for each pair of nodes while visiting each node exactly once.\nIn the Symmetric TSP, the distance from node i to node j is the equal to the distance from node j to node i.\nIn this project, you will write a Python program that will solve the five TSP instances under Instances folder\nusing the following metaheuristic algorithms;\n• Simulated Annealing (SA),\n• Tabu Search (TS), and\n• Genetic Algorithm (GA).\nWhen your program is started, it should first ask the user to select one of the methods above.
