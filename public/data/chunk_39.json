As the eldest son, he was groomed to inherit the family estate and title. Educated in hunting, swordsmanship, poetry, and diplomacy, Jean-Baptiste preferred chasing romantic interests and engaging in mischief with the servants' children.\n\nHis parents arranged his marriage to Aurelie, the daughter of an influential merchant family. After Aurelie became pregnant, Jean-Baptiste felt trapped and abandoned his wife and unborn child. He joined a merchant ship, only to find himself lured into a life of piracy. Eventually, he fled the pirate crew after a confrontation with the captain.\n\nJean-Baptiste now wanders the world as a rogue, seeking adventure and evading his past. He harbors guilt for abandoning his family and wonders about their fate. His desire for freedom clashes with his longing for love and stability. Skilled in stealth, deception, and persuasion, Jean-Baptiste's weakness is his cowardice. The choices you make as Jean-Baptiste will shape his destiny and the lives of those he encounters.\n\nThe story so far:\nThe setting of the campaign has a Mediterranean theme with a fantasy twist, fitting with the general lore of Dungeons and Dragons. The story takes place in the coastal town of Sirena's Call. I have just successfully completed a heist, retrieving the Eye of the Kraken from the mansion of a wealthy merchant named Horatio de Vallo.\n\nDuring the heist, I acquired additional loot, including a golden necklace with a sapphire pendant and a small golden dragon statuette.

Now, I'm considering my next move and looking for new opportunities and adventures in the world.\n\nAs the Dungeon Master, please provide me with choices, challenges, and opportunities to make decisions, and guide me through a mixture of roleplaying, exploration, and combat.

However, the implementation is missing. You need to implement this method to achieve the desired functionality.\n\n3. `load_from_json_file(cls, config_path)`: This method takes a JSON file path `config_path`, loads the contents of the file as a dictionary using the `json.load()` function, and returns an instance of `ConfigLoader` initialized with the configuration settings from the JSON file.
