Your task is to implement the `mergeArray` function. The function takes three parameters: `$base`, `$environment`, and `$local`. The function should merge these arrays, prioritizing values from `$local`, then `$environment`, and finally `$base`.\n\nThe function should follow these rules:\n1. If a key exists in all three arrays (`$local`, `$environment`, and `$base`), the value from `$local` should be used.\n2. If a key exists in both `$local` and `$environment` but not in `$base`, the value from `$local` should be used.\n3. If a key exists in both `$local` and `$base` but not in `$environment`, the value from `$local` should be used.\n4. If a key exists in both `$environment` and `$base` but not in `$local`, the value from `$environment` should be used.\n5. If a key exists only in `$local`, the value from `$local` should be used.\n6. If a key exists only in `$environment`, the value from `$environment` should be used.\n7. If a key exists only in `$base`, the value from `$base` should be used.\n\nWrite a function `mergeArray($base, $environment, $local)` that implements the above rules and returns the merged array.\n\n**Input**\n- Three arrays: `$base`, `$environment`, and `$local`. Each array can have up to 10^4 key-value pairs. The keys and values can be of any type.\n\n**Output**\n- Return a single merged array following the defined rules.\n\n**Note**\n- You can assume that the keys will always be strings and the values can be of any type.\n\n**Example**\n```\n$base = [\n    'key1' => 'baseValue1',\n    'key2' => 'baseValue2',\n    'key3' => 'baseValue3',\n];\n\n$environment = [\n    'key2' => 'environmentValue2',\n    'key3' => 'environmentValue3',\n    'key4' => 'environmentValue4',\n];\n\n$local = [\n    'key1' => 'localValue1',\n    'key4' => 'localValue4',\n    'key5' => 'localValue5',\n];\n\n$result = mergeArray($base, $environment, $local);\n// The merged array should be:\n// [\n//     'key1' => 'localValue1',\n//     'key2' => 'environmentValue2',\n//     'key3' => 'environmentValue3',\n//     'key4' => 'localValue4',\n//     'key5' => 'localValue5',\n// ]\n```"}, {"id": 5243, "actor": "Pet Care & Wildlife", "prompt": "I ain’t got no man.\nYou ain’t got no head!\nShe answered, Babe, what must I do?

Do not answer the questions, and only ask me one question at a time.\n\nSquashing Commits\nUsing squash for our commits is a very handy way of keeping our Git history tidy. It’s important to know how to squash, because this process may be the standard on some development teams. Squashing makes it easier for others to understand the history of your project. What often happens when a feature is merged, is we end up with some visually complex logs of all the changes a feature branch had on a main branch. These commits are important while the feature is in development, but aren’t really necessary when looking through the entire history of your main branch.\n\nLet’s say we want to squash the second commit into the first commit on the list, which is Create first file. First let’s rebase all the way back to our root commit by typing git rebase -i --root. Now what we’ll do is pick that first commit, as the one which the second commit is being squashed into:\n\npick e30ff48 Create first file\nsquash 92aa6f3 Create second file\npick 05e5413 Create third file and create fourth file\nRename the commit to Create first and second file, then finish the rebase. That’s it! Run git log and see how the first two commits got squashed together."}, {"id": 5246, "actor": "Renewable Energy & Climate Change", "prompt": "How can I write an essay which can be effective and allow the reader to understand my text with ease?
